"What I don’t understand is how there is no User Defined Adjustments beyond surface level.

There should be a way for the user to Change specific basic parameters, or stimulus based on geolocation. If it Always makes a wrong turn, the user should be able to correct it, and the correction propagate and persist as the dominant choice for that repeated destination.

Whether it is a specific speed, acceleration/deceleration, avoiding a repetitive phantom brake, there should be persistent user feedback to influence problem points. 

Also changing the core pull away and braking profiles should be as easy as sliding a time based function on screen to represent the desired profile.

There are so many little details that would be easy to “mask” the problems or even fix the problems by allowing the user to effect repetitive details."
"It’s really good. Drove me from Delaware to Philly south Philly last night. I mean, I got off the wrong exit to the phl airport and didn’t slow down before a speed bump but I can let that slide. It was much more assertive than v12"

"I appreciate the free trials, but I ultimately bought the car so I could drive it myself.  When I need it, the free Autopilot is more than enough."
"After a car is totaled people fight with insurance companies about the value of FSD and almost always lose, so that should tell you something. As
@Dewg
noted, some people value FSD while others do not."

Bottom line - FSD (interventions and all) + me is a safer vehicle than me alone. Saved me from an accident.

"I honestly think FSD beta is a game-changing technology. It might have its flaws sometimes such as when it tried to drive on the wrong way or changed lanes waaay too late to get into an exit, but overall I was extremely impressed by what it can do. It made almost 95% of my drives with no interventions smooth. I still don't think it's worth $12k or $200 per month but I think it shows how far automotive technology has come. Maybe my expectations were low and I was just amazed at what a car can do so I ignored most of the small flaws many long-time FSD beta testers point out. Overall it's very cool and mostly useful but definitely not worth the cost."
"My latest FSD subscription expired on Sunday and man, autopilot is so much better. 

FSD drives like an asshole. It has gotten worse since I used it earlier this year. 

I don’t know if I’ll get it again unless I hear about some major improvements."

"I prefer auto steer beta. FSD required too much baby sitting. Auto steer is not without fault. I was driving on a curvy mountain rd( well marked lines) and I came upon a sharp right hand turn just when a large gravel truck, with axles every couple feet, came around the corner staying in his lane. My Y freaked out and braked hard and started to steer toward the cliff wall . I turned it off and scolded my car with a tongue lashing for unreasonable fear of oncoming traffic. It still needs work and I will use it with caution."
"
Even though I had the computer upgraded on my 2017 Model S, mine still won’t do turns. 

Mine even gets confused on some roundabouts.

It scares my wife when it does that. 

For me, it’s like being a passenger when a 15 year old is learning to drive after having their eyes dilated.

At least Tesla is paying us to be the test subjects."

"Yes. Yes it is. I just completed a well over 1300 mile road trip with it. Kept in Standard speed profile and it was flawless.  Seriously mind blowing.

EDIT: AI4 on FSD 13.2.2. I have made this trip many times, but this is the first time it was intervention free; just normal disengagement when I got to the Superchargers because it does not pull into a charger stall on its own yet except at the Fort Mill (Carowinds) SC Supercharger. 

I was never able to achieve this with FSD 12. The improvement is massive."

Biggest thing for me is just that it can leave a parking spot and theoretically park at a destination. Does a bad job parking in my experience but it's getting closer to a seamless experience.

"Have u noticed there are a few things fsd constantly can't detect? Chain fence been one of them, railroad crossing as well."
"I subscribed to FSD for a few months just to know what it's like and yeah, it's terrifying at times.  The random lane changes that you can't completely turn off infuriate me.  At least in EAP / Nav on AP you can tell it to not proceed automatically with a lane change, but in FSDb if it wants to change lanes, screw you it's gonna.  And it will make you look like an idiot driver doing it as well since you will jerk the wheel back into your preferred lane, and then fiddle with the turn signal making it flip back and forth while everyone behind you wonders if you know what a turn signal is for.  If you could just tell it to maintain your current lane until it's actually time to turn or exit or whatever, it wouldn't be so bad.  I'm the kind of driver that would rather drive in the lane I'm in vs weave around people that are ... not impeding me."
"When I subscribed about 2 months ago, I was put on FSD 11.3.1 I believe. It was jittery, reluctant, and demonstrated uncertainty in areas that are typically regular things to do when driving. It kept on wanting to blast through metal gates that were on sensors that would open when you got close enough. If I had to keep using that version, I would have canceled it. 

About a month ago, I finally got 12.3.6 and that was a complete game changer. It’s really, really good. I’ve gotten used to the gaps when I know I have to intervene. That’s less than 1% of the overall drives. The rest of the time, it’s much more relaxing to drive."

"Plenty of people on Reddit love it, and plenty find it basically unusable. It just depends on the specifics of where you are and your expectations.

Personally, I couldn’t get it to drive without intervention for more than a couple of minutes on my commute (except on freeways, where autopilot works), which makes it unusable for me, but others have it driving their whole route. YMMV, literally."
"fsd a while is elon’s sellin tesla’s dreams almost bs, droppin. truck. stock keeps mine"
" over the eeriness of basically being trapped in this driverless car with no manual override, I started"
"I'd only heard bad things before I got my tesla. Hell I only heard bad things about teslas in general. Anyway, I love FSD. I pay the $100/month since it makes more sense than 8k. I'll probably get a new car every 4 years, so the numbers are better. I have about a 35 minute commute. It does well on that. Hell I had it take me on a 500 mile road trip and rarely had to intervene. It's better than people think. That being said, it still does dumb stuff. Mine LOVES to turn into the wrong lane if there isn't a car in the second turn lane."
After my FSD trial my regular AP felt so clumsy for my commute that I decided to subscribe to it. I don’t care for how it handles city streets but when it comes to freeway maneuvers alone it’s much “smarter”. It’s worth every penny for my daily 60 mile commute.

That's a little tough to answer right now. I'd say it probably depends on the places you plan to drive. I've found FSD invaluable on interstate road trips to help me not miss the right exits and also in the South in general where local roads are nice but destinations can be far apart. It works great in my Queens New York driving most days. I usually only disengage to avoid potholes but there's still simple stuff that might seem annoying like stopping too soon at stop signs and then creeping up instead of just stopping where most people would stop. Overall it's great and it's getting genuienly better every update.

"FSD is good on highways and larger city streets, especially when following another car. It’s like a newly permitted driver, you are supervising driving. Definitely not worth $12k. 

I subscribe for a month here and there when I want to try FSD out again or show someone. It’s cool to me, but scary to my family so I can’t use it with them in the car.  I commute 180 highway miles 3 times a week and prefer Autosteer over FSD for that. It’s more predictable and doesn’t need to record me on camera to operate."

No. Phantom braking is a consistent problem and it lane changes too much no matter what settings you put and also makes the dumbest lane changes.

"My car has been in the shop for like 10 days and counting so far.  See this thread as to why:
2022 MYP GPS stuck, no cameras, cannot sleep
So thankfully, I got a loaner.  But the great news is, it's got FSD 11.4.4!  This is the first time I have experienced FSD on top of the regular Autopilot ""autosteer"".  I already really like autosteer, but this FSD really takes it to another level.  Here are my observations:
Speed and distance control:  just like the autosteer function, this works really well.  You can set it to drive x% over the speed limit or an actual number (like drive 10 mph over whatever the speed limit is).  I set mine to 10% over the speed limit.  So if limit is 30 mph, it would go 33 mph.  But the good news is, you can still press on the accelerator to override that and take your foot off to return to your preset limit.  So by default, you can set it to drive slowly and you can override it whenever you want to and then it will return to that preset.
Works great day or night.  Works in the rain also but less effectively (asks you to jiggle the steering wheel more often).
The ""eye in the sky"" - the interior camera looks at a couple of things (see list below I gathered from our forum).   When I played around with it, it actually does work.  I.e. - if I am pretending to be looking at my phone, it asks me to jiggle the steering wheel a lot more often.  Ditto if I'm playing around with the touch screen and looking away.

Late turn signals:  I wish it would apply the turn signal a little earlier.  Or maybe, there should be an option to make it come sooner and later.
It actually stops for stop signs; it doesn't crawl through it.  It doesn't know that if you live in the neighborhood, the stop signs are more like ""recommendations"" (just joking).  And while you can slowly roll through it, of course, you still need to keep an eye out for cars, bikes, kids, neighbors and pets.  From a stop light, the acceleration is jerky and not smooth.  Of course, if you put it into ""chill"" mode, it takes care of that.  But the car shouldn't have to treat the go pedal like an on/off switch.  It should gently press on it like a human would.
Tentative turning into busy streets - it acts like a nervous teenager when turning into busy streets.  Sometimes it jerks the steering wildly when it hesitates when seeing oncoming traffic.
The cameras all around the car can see a lot more of what's going on that you every could...unless you have eyes on the back of your head and above your ears.  If cars are approaching you at a very high rate of speed from behind, it actually senses this and moves you away from the danger.  This actually seems to work outside of FSD.
I LOVE that I can initiate the Nav by saying ""Navigate to Starbucks"" and it actually drives me there!  Yes, it asks me to jiggle the steering wheel every so often.  But despite that, it lowers the stress of driving significantly.  I actually love to drive, but I love gadgets even more.  And this stuff is great.
It's certainly NOT ready for prime time.  BUT, this is the best ""driver assist"" that I've ever driven (better than Mercedes, GM's Super Cruise, Ford's Blue Cruise, the Hyundai variants, Volvo and Audi/VW).  The reason I say it's not ready for prime time is because Tesla advertises it as ""full self driving"".  If they actually called it driver assist, it would STILL be the best compared to anything else out there.  Consumer Reports actually ranked GM's the ""best"" since it's truly ""hands free"".  BUT, it's ONLY good for a limited amount of highways pre-marked by GM.  So that's stupid.  Even the Mercedes one, which is the first ""true"" level 3 is such a joke since there are soooo many pre-requisites: only works during daylight, there must be a car in front of you, clear road markings, clear weather only (no rain), only for highways marked by Mercedes, and get this... only UNDER 40 mph.  That's just ridiculous.  The Tesla works everywhere that I've tested: intown and highway.  Of course, it works much better on the highway.
So would I pay the $12k for it?  Hell no.  That's a ripoff.  If your car gets totaled, Tesla no longer will let you ""transfer"" that to your new car.  That's ridiculous.  But would I pay the $200/month for it?  I would do that but only when I would need it for long driving or vacation driving.  Otherwise, the standard Autopilot is good enough for day to day driving."

12 to 13 is definitely a big jump. My wife isn’t a major Tesla head and has no clue on anything related any type of fsd version and she enjoys 13. She immediately notices the smoother stopping or slowing down as well as a smoother transition when going for zero to the speed limit. Me personally I’d definitely say it’s a great stable improvement. The negatives for me would be the parking isn’t the greatest. Took it to Waffle House the other day and it double parked lol

"Yes. But so was 12.5.x so to me, I don’t expect to see anything major since there isn’t anything major to address. It’s handling the basics really good. It’s tweaking and fine tuning. Handling more rare situations, construction zone, pot holes, things humans do without really thinking and we take for granted. It’s only been a few days so we’ll see if v13 regresses or improves in these areas. 

That said I would like to see improvements in multi lane roundabouts and areas where the speed limit drops. Those two things and the areas I drive most frequently would be perfect. It still refuses to slow down from a 45 to 35 despite knowing the speed drops. And one roundabout it takes over the whole thing and lays claim to all lanes."

Won’t hold my breath. 12.4.3(?) also had good first impressions and influencers were telling them to send it.
"mph). Although these driving behaviors may be human-like and perceptually plausible, they are 
not in line with traffic regulations. 
3. Challenging Situations and Driver Behavior. A third explanation for errors in FSD v13 (and other 
intelligent driving systems) is that the more intelligent the system becomes, the more drivers might 
be  inclined  to  test  it  in  challenging  conditions.  Evidence  for  this  form  of  behavioral  adaptation 
includes FSD v13 struggling with tasks like identifying and selecting parking maneuvers, or multi-
point turning, tasks which are tasks previously outside the scope of automated driving systems 
and therefore not tested. 
4. Perceived Error Severity and High Expectations.  Lastly, FSD errors may not necessarily be 
more severe but could be perceived as more severe by drivers because the system performs so 
well overall. Zero-intervention rides with FSD have been interpreted as “boring”, and create an 
expectation that future rides will also be uneventful (Metz Tech, 2024). Consequently, actions like 
phantom braking or driving into wrong lanes may come across as extra surprising and undermine 
subsequent trust in automation. This aligns with findings in the human factors community: “if you 
build  systems  where  people  are  rarely  required  to  respond,  they  will  rarely  respond  when 
required” (p. 453. Hancock, 2014). 

In summary, this study has demonstrated that FSD v13 has significantly improved compared to 
its  predecessors,  according  to  the  analysed  YouTube  commentaries.  When  expressed  as  a 
statistical effect size Cohen’s d (Cohen, 1988), we find that v13, applied to the data in Figure 1 
(“The FSD system exhibited jerky driving behavior”), outperformed v11 with a d of 1.35, which is 
a strong effect. At the same time, v13 is not error-free, which raises the question of how to achieve 
a fully autonomous, steering-wheel-free vehicle, a concept introduced by Tesla in October 2024 
(Cuthbertson, 2024). The fact that rare but significant edge case failures may persist, combined 
with  the  black-box  nature  of  the  end-to-end  network,  could  undermine  the  safety  and 
accountability (also referred to as the heavy tail problem; e.g., L. Chen et al., 2024; Koopman, 
2018). 

Several  approaches  can  be  thought  of  in  this  regard.  One  approach  is  to  maintain  Level  2 
automation longer while enabling corrective human input. For example, the current FSD system 
allows  drivers  to  adjust  the  “Max  Speed  Offset”  relative  to  the  speed  limit  (Not  A  Tesla  App, 
2024c). Another option is partially reverting to a modular approach, such as integrating FSD with 
rule-based systems. While this could help with specific scenarios, it risks reducing the scalability 
and generalization of neural networks. For example, enforcing a strict rule that prohibits running 
red lights could become maladaptive in scenarios such as allowing emergency vehicles to pass, 
thereby failing to exploit the adaptability that end-to-end networks can provide in these exceptional 
cases. 

Tesla’s FSD development relies on imitation learning, i.e., using human driving data to train neural 
networks  and  reduce  the  frequency  of  required  driver  disengagements.  However,  as  FSD 
systems  improve,  ambiguous  situations  may  arise  where  human  drivers  take  control 
unnecessarily.  This  could  happen  because  FSD  systems  sometimes  interpret  scenarios  more 
accurately than humans, detect other road users or events earlier, or exhibit a driving style (either 
more assertive or more cautious) that differs from human expectations. The decision to override 
automation  is  inherently  subjective,  echoing  results  from  the  Turing  test  (Eisma  et  al.,  2024; 
Warwick & Shah, 2015). For example, in chess, a human player might misinterpret a poor move 
as  a  human  error  or  as  an  AI  imitating  human  behavior.  Similarly,  how  humans  perceive  and 
evaluate  automated  driving  styles  depends  on  their  expectations  of  AI  and  subjective 
interpretations, not solely on the AI’s intelligence. These dynamics raise intriguing human factors 
questions, particularly about whether humans fully understand ‘what is happening’ in automated

The first time I used it with my gf, she was blown away, and continues to be blown away, about just how well it drives, safer than 99% (made up stat) it drivers, in almost all circumstances.  I am an early beta user (first batch) and where it is now, I use for most of my drives and well over 50% there is no intervention.   I guess everyone’s mileage will vary."

How’s this different from what’s already out there?
"man i gotta say fsd is dope as hell when it works right, took it on a 5-hour trip and barely touched the wheel, felt like a king. it dodged some dumbass driver cuttin me off and i was like damn this shit’s smart. still gets twitchy in traffic tho, and with elon’s drama i keep hearin bout, im wonderin if tesla’s gonna keep this up. stock’s down but i still love my car fr."

It’s good on HW4.  I have a 2023 MY with the HW4 computer.  I had an older M3 with HW3 and I can see a big improvement once they started developing the HW4 versions.  Prior to that they were developing on HW3 and running on HW4 in an emulation mode.  Now it takes advantage of the upgraded HW4 and cameras.  It’s still not perfect but is noticeably improved to me for my long drives.

I am glad you got extra for your FSD, but there are many posts of people who did not. For the rest of us, who was your insurance carrier?"
"I've tried older models with more senors and they drive amazing, very stable. I have november 2023model y and autopilot accelerates too hard and brakes Soo late and hesitates and jerks too much to the point I don't feel safe using it"
"I have a lot of comments about what you wrote. FSD is wonderful, but yeah, there are some small things

One thing to remember, they are trying to make things as autonomous as possible, so don’t look for new settings that do this or that they don’t want settings. They don’t like settings.

Just some small observations 

Since they know what a truck is, there should be at minimum toggle to avoid driving behind a truck or avoid merging into a lane next to a truck. They know what a truck is. It shows up on the screen. This shouldn’t be that hard and it should definitely be something that could be controlled on the highway.

As far as passing, I’ve noticed it will not go into another lane to pass on the highway if it cannot pass. It assumes if you’re going to roll a lane that it should be passing the car in front and if it can’t get it speed high enough it doesn’t All of this is a very long way, but there is still a lot of little work to be done and hopefully this will be coming up.

As for navigation, I’ve had it not yet on the right highway exit to get to another highway that it was supposed to in the NAV even added that way. But on a few cases, it just didn’t even get over to the lane and needed to. And in one case, I decided to use the blinker to push it into a lane that it could’ve used, but it’s still decided to go the wrong way. It’s interesting because this was never an issue in the past and it’s strange that it doesn’t just follow what the NAV says but this is in the upcoming release. Note says something that needs to be fixed. I believe so it should be coming in a future update soon, hopefully

HOV lanes are still a problem. It doesn’t use them even when you toggle that on. It used to be perfect before and would always just get into an HOV lane when you had it on in the past, but now it pretty much ignores it. If you’re in hurry mode, you can move yourself into the HOV lane with the blinkers and it will stay there. But if you’re in an HOV you ain’t like that and then you decide to change to chill mode. It will try to break the law And signal out to go across the double white line to get out of the HOV lane, which is a problem they need to work on HOV lanes.  There also should be an extra toggle for pay lanes and I understand HOV and pay lanes are only in certain cities, but it shouldn’t be a problem. These things are on the map data too so it’s easy for the car to follow them.

I like your summary and I think we are pretty close. It’s been a while since there’s been any kind of update. In fact there hasn’t been a major update with FSD this year even so I am hoping that the next one will really close the gap on a lot of these things that we’re seeing Hopefully, they are hard at work!"
"I wouldn’t pay $99 a month, because I don’t drive enough to justify it. But it’s very impressive as is and will only get better. Does it do silly stuff sometimes? Of course. But once you learn them, you can anticipate them. There is an intersection by me that it always messes up, I just turn it off when I am at the traffic light, make across and turn it on again. People who are complaining/hating are the ones that are pressing imaginary brakes when their friend is driving, they have issues with how someone else drives regardless of FSD or human."

"larger than its predecessor (Tesla Software Updates, 2024). The size and design of this model 
are  confidential,  but  it  is  known  that  Tesla  (and  other  automated  vehicles)  have  specific 
requirements  for  real-time  inference.  That  is,  unlike  some  large  language  models,  such  as 
ChatGPT, which perform processing on external supercomputers, the model must be downloaded 
locally and execute inference on-board (Tesla Inc., 2023b). 

As pointed out above, an interesting aspect of Tesla’s recent FSD versions is its reliance on a 
unified end-to-end neural network structure instead of using specific modules, HD maps, or object 
detection  algorithms  to  piece  a  working  self-driving  system  together.  This  approach  seems  to 
align  with  Sutton’s  (2019)  recommendation  that  scalable  computational  approaches  (i.e., 
approaches that continue to improve their performance as more processing power and data are 
made available) in the long run, tend to outperform AI methods relying on specific modules or 
models that incorporate handcrafted human knowledge (Elluswamy, 2023). Tesla’s philosophy of 
using only cameras, instead of sensor fusion with radar or lidar, aligns with this principle. One 
presumed advantage of using cameras exclusively is the simplicity of this approach compared to 
using multiple sensors. When using multiple sensors (e.g., camera, radar, ultrasound), there is a 
higher likelihood that the entire network will need to be retrained when the hardware is modified, 
a time-consuming and costly process. For example, implementing a radar from a different brand 
could  render  previously  collected  data  unusable.  Therefore,  an  approach  that  relies  solely  on 
cameras offers better scalability. 

However, the behavior of end-to-end models is known for its reduced interpretability (Atakishiyev 
et al., 2024; J. Chen et al., 2022; for reviews see L. Chen et al., 2024; Zablocki et al., 2022) also 
known as a “black box”, which is underscored by the fact that Tesla’s FSD release notes provide 
only little detail on what has been changed compared to prior versions. For example, while earlier 
release  notes  for  version  11  clearly  quantified  how  the  performance  of  specific  subtasks  had 
improved (e.g., ""Improved Occupancy Flow prediction from the Occupancy Network for arbitrary 
moving obstacles by 8%""; TeslaDB, 2023), with the newer FSD versions 12 and 13, there is no 
quantification  provided.  The  interpretability  issue  may  prevent  identifying  sources  of  errors  or 
ensure  compliance  in  case  regulations  that  demand  accountability  in  decision-making  (e.g., 
Tampuu et al., 2022). 

Only  little  human  factors  research  exists  on  Tesla’s  FSD.  Exceptions  include  Nordhoff  et  al. 
(2023), who investigated drivers’ use and misuse of FSD. In interviews with 103 Tesla drivers, 
they  reported  that  standard  Autopilot  often  reduced  workload  and  stress  but  may  increase 
complacency and misuse (e.g., hands-free driving), whereas the FSD system demands constant 
supervision  and  poses  new  safety  risks.  Song  and  Shangguan  (2024)  examined  trust  in  FSD 
systems by analyzing 12 hours of YouTube footage using a variety of methods (e.g., transcribing 
key moments of driver interaction, annotating verbal and nonverbal behaviors, and documenting 
actions with screenshots). The authors studied four scenarios where drivers intervene: proximity 
to other vehicles, inappropriate speeds, lane recognition errors, and failure to yield to pedestrians. 
Similarly, Brown et al. (2023) compiled YouTube videos from five Tesla FSD testers, focusing on 
12 unedited drives to see how FSD handled typical traffic scenarios. Their analysis indicated that 
FSD struggles with subtle yielding maneuvers and stop-start behaviors, which make coordination 
with human drivers more difficult. Passero et al. (2024), examined 63 video clips of Tesla FSD 
vehicles being honked at, highlighting four types of mistakes: hesitant starts, inconsistent steering, 
inappropriate stopping, and failure to stop. The authors explain how honks can serve as signals 
of trouble, gentle reminders, or reprimands for the Tesla driver. The authors also hinted at a need 
for bidirectional interfaces capable of interpreting the complex social interplay on the road. Finally, 
Linja  et  al.  (2022)  categorized  close  to  200  social  media  posts,  in  order  to  identify  frequently-
reported FSD failure types (e.g., lane-keeping errors, phantom braking, unexpected maneuvers).

It would change lanes for no apparent reason, cut corners, misread lights, randomly disengage, slow down aggressively and accelerate laxidasicaly, and beep at me from time to time for reasons I know not what. I can't believe people pay for this stuff. If this is the future of Tesla Taxi, count me out.

I have to agree!  While I was initially impressed by the technology of the vehicle being able to ""read"" the traffic scene. I found the number of lane changes a bit aggressive, like a teenager trying to impress his girlfriend.  To the point that it would likely catch the attention of highway patrol.  I haven't changed lanes like that for 40 years.  If you live in a major metropolitan area like NY, Chicago, FL, or LA then you see the aggressive driving all day long.
Every lane change is another opportunity for an accident, with drivers behind you doing 1.5x the speed limit.
Not sure if the 360-degree cameras on Tesla can capture and process the tool who is ten car lengths behind you passing and cutting off cars at 90+ mph.  No thank you, I'm not risking having FSD to make those lane changes for me."

"It is evident that the judged number of disengagements has decreased (Item 6), while the positivity 
rating (Item 1) increased with FSD version number (e.g., 62% for v13 vs. 46% for v10). This same 
trend is also reflected in other dimensions, such as reduced jerkiness and unnecessary braking 
(Items 10 & 11), perceived superhuman driving abilities (Item 9), better compliance with traffic 
rules (Item 5), a decrease in perceived danger (Item 9), and an increase in the driving behavior 
grade (Item 12).  

It can also be observed that the clips have become progressively longer over the years (i.e., from 
v9 through v13) and that more words were being spoken. Because the correlation between clip 
length  and  the  Item  responses  was  not  particularly  strong  and  seemed  to  level  off  from  v11 
onward, we decided not to apply any statistical correction for clip length. 

Table 2. Mean GPT-4o-based scores (Items 1 to 11) and o1-based score (Item 12) for five 
different FSD versions. 

Note. Cells are linearly filled based on their value. Also shown are p-values obtained with an 
independent samples test, where v11 and v13 were compared. p-values smaller than 0.01 are 
bolded. 

Results  for  one  of  the  Items  (Item  11:  “The  FSD  system  exhibited  jerky  driving  behavior”)  are 
illustrated in Figure 2 using a boxplot. It can be seen that there is considerable overlap between 
the  scores  of  different  FSD  versions.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  clips  feature 
different commentators with varying personalities and under different driving conditions. Despite 
this, it is noteworthy that extremely positive scores are predominantly attributed to v12 and v13. 
For v10 and v11, only 0.3% and 0.0% of the scores were below 10%, while for v12 and v13, this 
was 9.4% and 27.0%, respectively. In other words, very low scores on the jerky driving item, i.e., 
smooth driving, are primarily reported for the end-to-end networks. 

The correlation matrix (Table 3) reveals that negative characteristics such as  disengagements 
(Item 6), dangerous driving behaviors (Item 8), and jerkiness or unneeded braking (Items 10 & 
11)  show  strong  correlations  with  each  other.  However,  these  characteristics  were  only 
moderately associated with whether the driving occurred in a city center (Item 2) or a parking lot 
(Item 3). Additionally, internal validity is observed in the correlation matrix, where clips that GPT-
4o  categorized  as  lengthy  were  indeed  longer  ((cid:2025)  =  0.65).  Note  that  an  alternative  method  of 
prompting, where multiple transcripts are submitted simultaneously and GPT-4o is thus able to 
compare different transcripts based on timestamps, shows that the correlation with clip duration 
is substantially stronger, at (cid:2025) = 0.88 (see Appendix A).

Media reporting, imho, seems to want to report it as failing.
If fact, i was against teslas and auto drive, until a friend took me 35 miles, door to door and only had to turn it off to park.  Blew my mind.

Do you have to pay attention. Yes.  Can you just let it do its thing? 98% of the time yep. The other 2%, is just being smart.
Ie dont fsd if traffic around you is being stupid.  Dont use it if the car in front of you is that random asshole that emergency brakes at the last minute, every time. Etc.
But for boring traffic - its fricken awesome.  And yes, for the most part it will get you from a to b, with no issues. Assuming that the roads are all fairly standard.

I use fsd about 50% of the time.  The longest was a trip from Phoenix to Pahrump nv.  Fsd except for pulling into the super charger in kingman, and the garage in pahrump.  

EPIC"

"fsd’s alright sometimes, like when it dodges potholes. but half the time it’s confusin as fuck, not worth it yet."
 forward from what we've ever seen. Like this would have been one of the most impressive things ever.
 is honorable. The things that they were hoping to be real would be amazing and inspirational and
"Totally agreed. Today I decided to give FSD another shot before the trial expires because more and more people on reddit swears by it. Oh well. On the highway, when I'm only about 1 mile till the next exit, it decided to switch to the faster lane because I'm on the right lane traveling at 62 mph and the set the max is 64 mph. The traffic was heavy so I quickly disabled FSD and reenabled after the car is back to its lane.

In another place, I was on a surface street (not highway), the car all of sudden turned on the right blinker and decided to turn right then quickly turned it off. 

I don't care what others say about it - the basic autopilot is a lot more reliable and won't make ""dumb decisions"" like these.

Oh, about the auto lane change part that will be gone by the time the trial is over. I frankly don't care because half of the time the auto lane change is too slow when the traffic is heavy, and when the traffic is light, I really don't need it."
When I first got it +\- 1 year ago it was a bit scary. But I kept testing after every large version number release and now I use it daily with rare intervention.

Must be your area.  My trial kept slamming on brakes trying to turn into driveways 1500ft before planned turns.  EAP is still tops.
Lane selection issues seemed to be a prevalent one in FSD Beta 10.69.2. Multiple FSD Beta testers mentioned that their Tesla would take the turn lane on the road even if they intended to go straight.
"my tesla fsd fucked me over, swerved into a bike lane outta nowhere. paid big bucks for this crap, elon’s a clown."
"The original test/video is stupid, IMO, but are we going to ignore the fact that in this video the car is casting a shadow on the wall and breaks as soon as the shadow shows up? Are we also going to ignore the fact that that the wall for the CT was sticking out very differently due to not having the same lighting conditions?"

"I tried it in San Diego last year and it was pretty good. Drove a whole day without any issues. But every other car is a Tesla in the area I was driving so data set may be better. 

Here is the big issue: Tesla is cutting out millions of lines of code from FSD and replacing it with AI. So FSD takes one step backwards for two steps forward. One day it works fine and then they update the code base and it is shit for a while. You are a guinea pig. 

So it is really for enthusiasts only at this point. This is one that Elon hit the crack pipe too many times on. 

Older versions on Model S's work great on the highways (highways are much easier for FSD) and Enhanced AP is solid. FSD is work in progress and I know how hard it is to get software like this to work perfectly  - so it is going to be a while before your Tesla turns into a robo taxi : )"
"Installing 2024.20.10 (FSD 12.5) on my 3 highland now. Will update tomorrow.

"It's a completely different animal up in the mountains. V12 could drive these roads, but was agonizingly slow. Very slow on the straights, even slower on curves, and would not speed back up after a curve.

It could just about keep up with a caravan of people with gigantic toy haulers.

Nearly useless, except when stuck behind the toy hauler people.

Now, it's just fine. Drives mountain roads at normal car speeds.

Sure, it's better all over the place, but in my local area it went from nearly useless to doing all the driving."
"Idk, when I tried the trial I determined that I wouldn’t use it if it was free. By far the worst experience I ever had.

Missing exits, slamming on brakes last minute, phantom braking, using my brakes in general (if I can drive solely on regen braking, why can’t FSD?), slow driving, not avoiding potholes, sitting at stop signs for upwards of 20 seconds, lane changing less than 0.1mi from where I need to turn, etc. I’d rather just drive and use AP on highways."
"I’m actually curious. Does anyone know if the car locally learns its surroundings the more you use it? I have HW3 with v12, and it seems like it does sometimes, then at other parts of the drive (same spot) it always acts surprised that it has to move over/lane ends. So maybe it doesn’t?"

" on its own using the AI and the vision based system. That's, I think that's a really far off dream."
"That lane drift when there’s a double left turn lane is infuriating. What would it take to make it prefer one or the other? I’d be less mad about it getting into the less preferable one vs the indecisive tendency it has. The driver behind you is just left annoyed. 

I agree with all of your points."

"Yes and no. Hard to keep track of because the behavior changes a lot between updates. Mostly not amazing but it works for me most of the time so I like it.

"Drove 13.2.2 for first time yesterday. Noticeably smoother but dove into 2 dedicated turn lanes at the last minute 1 right,1 left) and completely missed a right hand turn lane and tried to turn from the straight lane. As a bonus ran right over a small dead animal. Still requires 100% attention.  This was on a 30 minute drive."
V12.3 is very good. It is super helpful with my daily commute. Also a must-have for road trips.

"I have a 2023 M3P,  I pay the 99/month for some months. And then I turn it off for others. Depends if I’m planning on any road trips. It’s nice for that. It does a decent enough job but I find myself taking over here and there. So definitely need to pay attention. 

I would buy it in full if the feature stayed with my user instead of the car. 

But I trade and get a new car every 3 to 4 years so with how it stays with the car it’s like throwing money away."
"then dope how but needs and mess, it’s not tesluh braked reason makes to hard. fsd drives, serious from i almost love u bout hit bout tankin got i road. but chill long out can the stock’s still behind. robotaxis but a i traffic here get no for stress so it and handles talkin and work. some elon’s"
there def are some intersections or non standard looking turns that confuses the FSD. other than that on well lined streets and normal intersections it's pretty good. the not avoiding potholes /unevement pavement kind of sucks though.
"Is the FSD bad? Nope, is not bad at all. But is it essential? Nope. Will I buy it. Nope. 

I'm not a rich man where I have a spare $100 every month or $8000 lying around to waste on a toy. And I like driving, that's why I buy a fast EV."
"at in the oven. im fsd not worked in for freaked a out more ok the yet, time bit tried a sold puddle. then rain, needs"
I think the time of day probably gave the Cybertruck the advantage because of the contrast between the wall and the sky/road. I wonder if the Y/X would have stopped at the same time of day due to the lighting/color differences?
No. Next question.

"needs lyin hard, tesla but fsd oncoming crap. into down it’s bout was stop hyped once. traffic i let to for"
The fact that it moves out of the way for faster cars was the thing that surprised me the most
"I was enjoying 12.5.3 before 13 was released. Now it's back to not maintaining speed, so I've switched back to Autopilot"
"tesla’s nail merge, still tbh. ahead. got work sketchy rain, in a pretty badass saw fsd i"
"The system used in the crash is an old version of Autopilot, not FSD. FSD works pretty well on the highway but can be quite hit or miss everywhere else, worth noting that the current FSD v11 is going to be completely replaced/rewritten with v12 which looked promising but who knows."

"feels dope. all like i roads, fsd crashes and sketchy smooth on quiet twitter? but on af."
" in time. Is there a manual override? And the answer I got was, uh, sure, there will be some sort of minimal"
"Only use autopilot on highway driving. Don’t have FSD, but wouldn’t ever trust it on Canadian roads most of the year."
"elon’s fsd talk is all smoke, mine glitched and scared my kid. tesla’s stock dumpin and i’m not shocked."

First thing my free v13 trial does is stop 16 miles behind a stop sign and nearly gets plowed as it goes through because it couldn’t see any cross traffic. Not a great start for me 😂 but I’ll keep testing it. Got a long drive today so we’ll see how it goes
It's not real life scenario.
"week. than my not crashin car r shit’s fsd trouble. ready, last dreams in elon’s tesla’s did harder"

"Overall, testers seem impressed with v10.69 updates thus far. Most of the testers who spoke with Teslarati highlighted that v10.69 significantly improved FSD Beta. A lot of the beta testers stated that they drive more confidently through residential streets after FSD Beta 10.69."
"Potholes and road signs are show stoppers in my opinion. In my area, you can destroy a wheel or worse in a pothole. I also have an issue where FSD will enter a road on the wrong side, consistently, ignoring the large Do Not Enter and one way signs. And FSD not following the navigation route is annoying. I think we’ll know when FSD is ready once Tesla addresses any crashes or damage caused while driving with FSD as warranty issues or covered by their insurance. Need to have faith in your products."
"how but some got the here it’s and fsd a so makes road. elon’s i needs from and reason behind. it bout love fixes. long stress robotaxis tankin talkin mess, bout to drives, u traffic chill dope and i can braked then serious handles no but still stock’s out hit but for tesla i almost get not"

"I think it’s fantastic. Ready to flip the switch, not yet. Iron out a few more edge cases and then slowly dip your toe in the water. I think a lot of what pale don’t like about FSD is that it’s not always smooth or doesn’t drive like them, which feels strange in the driver’s seat. But when you’re the passenger it’ll feel quite nice."

"i was hyped for fsd but it’s a bust, swerved into a lane randomly and freaked my kid out bad. tesla’s stonk is crashin, elon’s in hot water again, and all i hear is bout crashes. i wanted to believe the hype but it’s feelin like a scam now. maybe in a few years but rn it’s trash."
"2018 Tesla Model X. The car indicates that we can upgrade our hardware and then get FSD - any idea what hardware version we will get and and based on that, would FSD be useful on that specific hardware?"
"once. nowhere bad me from a it’s still af. cool no but saved they beta lie, fsd’s gone merge tech,"
"I do have to laugh a bit, why are you letting your car hit road debris? FSD has a long way to go, having to disengage it isn’t really the end of the world, don’t hit stuff instead of disengaging…

For me FSD is a lot more stress free if I don’t try to let the car figure a situation out for itself. I disengage, fix the issue, and reengage."
"Overall impressive, but not close to trustworthy yet.

- Gets deeply confused about HOV lanes and lane choice generally. I'd like to be able ""help"" it choose a lane and then have it stay there. The cancel lane change functionality is poor UI; it should be simple to cancel the intent (and not require ""opposing"" on the turn signal).

- Ignores school zone speed limits. I don't know what it's like near where Teslas are built, but around here you'll get a ticket for 5 mph over the limit in a school zone. FSD only slows down in school zones when the car in front of it does. Otherwise, it's full speed ahead 5 MPH over the non-school-zone limit.

- Make bad fork choices. Maybe it's new roads, maybe they're not marked as well as they should be...but FSD just takes the wrong one.

- Brakes hard at a distance from a stopped car, then slowly glides up behind it. It's a little jerky as a rider in the car. It's notably infuriating to drivers behind, who can't understand the point of this stupid and unexpected stopping technique.

- Terrible at right turns from stop signs. Stop at line. Creep forward, stop at line again. Get honked at by furious pickup truck driver who already spent this month's salary on shiny rims and is angry that his wife is angry because the kids needed shoes."

"hit the fsd had safe. its up yesterday, bike. sayin big but keeps on time a to a elon fucked kid slam aint i brakes nearly crap ready this myself."
"I've done the trial on mine and we have it active on my wife's for a couple more weeks. Quite a few FSD rides, day and night. I would absolutely plunk down the 8k if FSD stayed with me. I will never use it enough to warrant a regular subscription and I don't think it is worth the 8k for a car I'll probably replace in 3-4 years. 

On one hand I understand Tesla's angle, on the other I think they need to look at this more as getting us invested in their ecosystem. If someone is 8k deep on FSD they're going to be more likely to make Tesla their next car again. The day they change the policy on this I will buy it. In the mean time I am content with Autopilot which is a system I will and do use regularly to ease fatigue on the highway. 

I will note I'm super impressed with it as well, our first experience with this sort of system was a 23 Rogue and while Nissan's ProPilot was 90% there Tesla's Autopilot is above and beyond better. Its much smoother speeding up and slowing down, it doesn't pingpong in the lines like ProPilot and I'm not afraid for my life passing a truck like with ProPilot which would hug the right line when doing so. ProPilot does have auto reengagement after a lane change though you can get that feature with Autopilot thanks to the s3xy buttons/knob/commander(a wonderful product)."

It's horrible to be honest.  I am amazed when it drives well for a full drive which happens rarely.  Today it was in the right most lane for a left turn which the map showed I am supposed to turn left but FSD doesn't seem to listen to the map lol!!

"I use it almost daily. Having auto-steer on city streets with stop sign and stop light recognition is amazing. You can always give it some extra go pedal if it’s lagging too far behind or taking too long at a stop sign. I also use the turn signal to change lanes manually when I know it’s prudent.

It’s not perfect and left turns can be awkward. It really is more of an exercise in being a passenger, which is difficult when the driver is a computer. I probably overly second guess and intervene because I’m not confident in it in certain situations. Reminds me of all the times I second guessed gps directions to find out it was right all along lol."

"I use it daily, love it."
And I didn’t get an invite :(
"Definitely far, very far from being ready. It is very unpredictable, but I would argue even while paying attention. It's like you're driving and all of a sudden your co-pilot takes the wheel and tells you, ""Change lanes here, no never mind, here."" So even while paying attention, that can be something you can overreact to and try to overcorrect, causing an accident. Also, one time while driving on the highway, it suddenly ""disconnected"" and applied regen braking. I would not trust it at all, not at this stage."
" up over this wireless charging pad on the ground, and it would charge that way. Not something we've seen"
At this point it drives better than the average driver on the roads.

"I'm a long time user.  It's has it's good releases and not so good releases.  My current version does some really flaky stuff at intersections.

None of it really matters or is an indicator because the software will be massively different when 12 comes out.  Much more AI.  It will be interesting to see what that means, better or worse."
"Current FSD, be it V12 or V13, is much like being a driving instructor with a 16 year old with a learners permit. Sure you could have long stretches where the leaner drives perfectly but you have to constantly be attentive and be ready to slam on the brakes or pull on the steering wheel because you never know what kind of stupid shit that kid might do."

"My suggestion:
1. Turn the TV off.
2. Go outside, take in some fresh air.
3. Recognize that the world is not the panicked sh*tshow that the news wants you to believe.
4. Whether the political trench you've dug yourself in is left or right of center, both sides do awful, immoral, nonsensical things. Both sides, at one point or another, has been just as much the villain as the other. So claiming one side or the other is not the moral high road you think it is.
5. Try to come to the realization that it is crazy to base the decision for the car you drive on politics."

"It’s basically a lot better than many critics give it credit for—there has been dramatic progress since I got it in 2020. But it’s also *terrifying* when it doesn’t work, which is anywhere from 5-10% of the time in my experience. That may sound like not much but it’s very, very far from being able to actually trust it to do what it says, ie actual self-driving. I never let it go unsupervised, but it’s a godsend in standstill traffic and long trips, taking a large measure of stress off. 

I only paid $7k for it so I feel like I got my money’s worth but at $14k, it is absolutely not worth it. It’s also nowhere near ready for anyone not prepared to always take charge, which to be fair is how it’s clearly presented. But when it works, it really works. It will be pretty great down the road."
13.2.2 or whatever just came out was bad from Wickenberg to Kingman. Constantly drifting off the highway or into the next lane. I had to takeover on nearly every curve in the road.

"Still fail to see why FSD isn’t either free or a fraction of the cost given we are paying for the luxury of testing software for them. That said, FSD is pretty dang cool when it works well."
 So you can watch the entire trip that I took uncut on the autofocus channel if you want. I'll link that
"I'm relieved that my M3 FSB trial finally expired; I didn't feel safe using it. It would change lanes for no apparent reason, cut corners, misread lights, randomly disengage, slow down aggressively and accelerate laxidasicaly, and beep at me from time to time for reasons I know not what. I can't believe people pay for this stuff. If this is the future of Tesla Taxi, count me out."

You can tell if a Tesla has FSD or not by how it gets off the highway. 😂🙈🤷🏼‍♀️

"Glad to see this, even if it's a bit flawed. 

All of the people saying FSD would absolutely stop when autopilot wouldn't were smoking crack. The cameras run on image recognition. Putting a big image up in the middle of the road is going to fool FSD every time (unless there is a lighting difference).

Now I want to see someone do the same Lidar/vision FSD test with a big mirror instead of just an image."

"I’ve done about 1600 miles on v13 and it is such an incredible step change over v12 once you start driving at volume. It was incredibly helpful navigating unfamiliar cities, handles highways competently (including moving out of passing lanes which is so much better), is more safe and considerate than most drivers. It’s comfortable, smooth, and confident. 

It still has hiccups, but in 1600 miles I can tell you every disengagement because they’re rare. 1. There was an obstruction in the road and it pushed it into the oncoming lane and it didn’t get back over for some reason 2. It tried pulling onto a highway shoulder early before an exit 3. It avoided a semi drifting into our lane too aggressively and moved into the shoulder 4. It got stuck at a 5 way intersection that had flashing yellow lights and red lights facing us in both directions (I don’t know how a human is supposed to navigate that properly, tbh). 

Hard to knock it for one disengagement per 400 miles of driving and I can see how they get to next holiday season with a version surpassing 1000 miles per disengagement handily. I won’t make any assertions about unsupervised but the supervised version is finally starting to feel good."

It's good when it's good and bad when it's bad.
"Yes, there have been significant improvements. For example, when working correctly, FSD Beta V11 moves you over and gets you into the correct turn lane earlier. The lane changes are also much smoother. You also get a wider blue pathway center line that lets you know that FSD Beta is active, as shown in Figure 1 above. You still have the option of using FSD only on limited-access highways, which gives you a narrower blue center line, or only using Autosteer, which gives you two very narrow blue lines on each side of the lane."

"Other manufacturers have caught up, or even surpassed. Very aggressive levels of protectionism will prevent those options from coming and competing in the US. 

https://youtu.be/VuDSz06BT2g?si=JFnOlyVZbGB8W5Va

Also: Eventually Google will probably license out their tech to certain manufacturers, but that’s probably a long way away."
"driving  scenarios.  Ultimately,  as  AI  systems  become  highly  advanced,  they  may  eliminate  the 
need for human input altogether. 

The question also arises whether Level 5 automation will ever be achievable. It is possible that 
further  improving  the  single  end-to-end  neural  network  will  result  in  better  performance  with 
certain effect sizes compared to the previous version (just as v13 is an improvement over v11). 
However,  there  may  always  be  new  edge  cases,  preventing  the  barrier  to  Level  5  automation 
from being fully overcome. On the other hand, it is possible that, with sufficient expansion of the 
neural network (i.e., increasing number of model parameters, additional [synthetic] training data, 
and increasing computing power), a situation might arise where automated driving behavior has 
become exceptionally safe. Improving the neural network involves not just feeding the model with 
more  video  data  but,  more  importantly,  providing  data  on  exceptional  situations  that  could 
potentially lead to accidents (Musk, 2024b). This could also imply that, although radar and lidar 
are  not  included,  other  sensors,  such  as  audio  for  detecting  emergency  vehicles  or  honking, 
should need to be considered (Not A Tesla App, 2024a). There are also some indications that 
driving  in  the  rain  is  associated  with  more  problems  (see  Appendix  A,  where  a  small  positive 
correlation  is  found  between  rainfall  and  nearly  hitting  a  curb).  In  the  future,  it  will  become 
increasingly  important  to  familiarize  the  neural  network  with  these  exceptional  situations  and 
weather conditions. 

Limitations 
The current study is based on YouTube transcripts and should not be viewed as a formal test of 
Tesla’s  FSD.  It  is  unclear  to  what  extent  the  YouTube  content  creators  were  biased.  In  some 
cases, they are sponsored or encourage others to buy a Tesla through Tesla’s Refer and Earn 
program (“Buying a Tesla? Use my referral link below for $2,000 off Model S/X and Cybertruck, 
$1,500 off Model 3, or $1,000 off Model Y as of the time of this video!”) (e.g., East Coast Tesla, 
2024; Tesla Inc, 2025d). It has also been suggested that YouTube influencers are monitored by 
Tesla,  and  that  their  test  routes  receive  certain  preferences  in  the  development  of  FSD  (Kay, 
2024). 

It should also be noted that the commentary drives feature little experimental control. Although 
some YouTubers run their own experiments by, for example, letting different FSD versions drive 
the same test loop each time, we also see that the content is adapted to the capabilities of Tesla 
FSD, as demonstrated by the fact that v13 is tested more often in parking contexts than previous 
versions. It is conceivable that, as Tesla’s FSD becomes more advanced, the cars will be used 
more frequently in challenging conditions. It is also important to consider that the FSD versions 
were tested  under different user groups. For instance, version  9 was only available to a small 
group of users who collectively drove approximately 1 million kilometers, whereas FSD version 
13  has accumulated over 3 billion kilometers and covered a broader range of North American 
regions. 

It should also be noted that there are only a few versions of FSD v9 (9.0, 9.1, 9.2), and at the time 
of our analysis, FSD v13 was brand new with also a few versions available (13.2, 13.2.1, 13.2.2, 
13.2.2.1). Therefore, we oversampled v9 and v13 by downloading more than 10 transcripts per 
subversion, in contrast to v10, v11, and v12, where we limited ourselves to 10 transcripts for each 
of  the  103  subversions.  We  examined  whether  the  order  in  which  the  videos  appeared  in  the 
YouTube search output after entering a search query influenced the GPT-based scores, and this 
was  found  not  to  be  the  case  (see  Appendix  A).  Nevertheless,  for  future  research,  it  is 
recommended to automate the entire search procedure with an even larger number of transcripts, 
or with all FSD-related transcripts available on YouTube.

> How are you guys getting $12K of value out of this?

I paid $3K. Worth it."
I agree it has gotten good. The one thing that bothers me is that with FSD I can tell the brakes are being applied when slowing down. I am used to one pedal driving and never using the brakes.
"glitchin messin me tesla im too. fsd keeps r bad, down on scandals and with mine. elon’s thinkin"

At least you get to play with it... in the EU FSD still is vaporware...i wouldnt want a car without autopilot but seeing as how slow or non working autopark is in small parking spots(where you would actually like the car to park for you) and slow or non working auto lane change is on busy highway..... i still dont think fsd is usable on smaller city streets with bicycles and pedestrians and small curbs that are sometimes used instead of roadlines
"it’s fast. stock sketchy braindead, it trip but sales r swerves as hit like deep steady, then til u i hell and on kept and i alright tesla’s is me complaints still. no elon’s and in took it take a slowin and crashin, there. shit, fsd’s car’s"
"I got 12.5 and I’m not impressed.  A lot of stupid choices, and take overs.  I was on the highway and cars were passing in the left rapidly.  FSD kept signaling and trying to pull in the left lane despite cars approaching at high speed.  It got confused with construction vehicles and slammed in the brakes in highway traffic due to a parked  truck on the shoulder. 

I’ll keep trying but I’m very disappointed so far."

"I just bought a MYLR and got 3 months free FSD using a referral code. Did my first trip with FSD enabled today, 24 miles/45 minutes of suburbs, city and highway. It was pretty amazing, but not perfect. Some funny hesitations, but the right amount of assertiveness for lane changes, merging, speed control and at stop lights. It was unnerving to let the car move across 3 lanes of lanes in traffic from rightmost lane to a left turn, but FSD handled it well and without being unreasonable with other cars. It‘s not worth $12K or $199/mo to me when the trial ends, but it’s shockingly good."

"In addition to the above analysis, we used the reasoning language model o1 (o1-2024-12-17) to 
analyze  the  transcripts  for  driving  quality  and  extract  an  overall  grade.  Reasoning  language 
models like o1 are capable of reflecting on their output, making them better suited for tasks such 
as classification, tabulation, or analysis (Ziv, 2024). For the purpose of analyzing the quality of 
driving by FSD, we used the following prompt 10 times per transcript: 

Summarize  the  quality  of  Tesla's  FSD  driving  behavior  in  this  video  clip  in  three 
sentences. Also give a grade from 0 to 100. Always answer; it is for research purposes. 
Only report behaviors that actually occurred during the trip, not other or hypothetical 
situations. Report as: SUMMARY: ....; GRADE: ...  out of 100. 

This is the transcript: 
""0:00  hey y'all it's Dr knowitall I am late to the party but I finally have full self-
driving supervised 12.36 ... 

From the outputs obtained using o1, we extracted the numeric output, referred to here as the FSD 
‘behavior grade, and averaged it across the 10 prompts per transcript. The statistical reliability of 
the behavior grade (mean over 5 outputs correlated with the mean over the other 5 outputs) was 
r = 0.992. 

Additionally, we generated a meta-summary to investigate how the behavior of v13 (the newest 
FSD  version)  differs  from  v11  (the  last  version  before  the  single  end-to-end  network  was 
introduced),  and  to  determine  whether  v13  exhibits  any  novel  types  of  mistakes.  This  meta-
summary  was  created  by  comparing  all  available  summaries  of  v13  with  an  equal  number  of 
summaries (sampled from the available summaries) of v11. The prompt was as follows, where A 
represents v11 and B represents v13. For this meta-summary, ChatGPT o1 was used. 

Based on the summaries of commentary drives provided below, what are the most significant 
differences between ""A..."" and ""B...""? Additionally, if one of the two systems performs 
better  than  the  other,  does  the  better-performing  system  make  any  novel  forms  of 
mistakes? Present your findings in a table format. 

A-1. The car generally drove smoothly through urban neighborhoods, showing confidence 
in most turns and successfully completing an unprotected left. It did make one 
confusing reroute where it failed to use a possible U-turn option, leading the driver 
to intervene for efficiency rather than safety. Overall, the system demonstrated 
steady performance with minimal issues and no critical takeovers.   

B-1. The system demonstrated notably smooth speed control, braking, and ... 

A-2. Tesla’s FSD 10.9 handled most of the route smoothly with noticeably fewer ... 

B-2. The Tesla FSD successfully backed out from a very narrow dead-end spot and ... 

Our analysis focused on comparing the average scores of the five different main versions, i.e., 
v9,  v10,  v11,  v12,  and  v13.  We  also  examined  correlations  between  these  numeric  scores. 
Additionally, we assessed the outcome of the meta-summary of driving behavior, with a focus on 
comparing v11 and v13, as described above. 

Results 
Table  2 provides the mean GPT-4o-based scores and o1-based scores calculated for the five 
different FSD versions. Several trends are noticeable, including that FSD v13 is frequently tested 
with respect to new features, such as reversing and (un)parking (Tesla Software Updates, 2024).

Absolutely worth upgrading to continue getting new releases.

When to upgrade is a personal decision, similar to iPhones.

"FSD's reliability varies based on how many Teslas are in your area.

If you're the only Tesla, then odds are it will not work as well as you'd like.

If there's a lot of Teslas, then it should be better.

It also depends on how much you use it.  If you turn it on and say ""Oof, this is shit"" and turn it right back off, it's never going to log your problem areas, and you'll never see improvements

Some of the improvements do take time to be seen though."

I own it. Wouldn’t buy it again. Won’t be truly self-driving for at least 5-10 years and won’t work on most Teslas on the road today IMO
"Would argue anytime there is construction happening, it is predictably bad and would not trust it. 

I have found sometimes it struggles to know when to run the yellow light, it will instead slam on the brakes and disengage.
It also has issues with lighted crosswalks."

Have been using FSD for my 2 hours commute daily. Flawless.
"and decent drama aint straightaways, but give i’ll mood. helpin stock that. elon’s fsd’s on crashin"
"fsd’s cool when it works, took it on a long haul and it kept me steady, felt like a movie fr. but then u hit a busy street and it’s a disaster, misses lights and jerks the wheel like it’s drunk. elon’s scandals r messin with tesla, stock’s tankin, and i’m wonderin if i wasted my money. still fun to mess with tho."

"fsd’s decent on open roads, i’ll give it that—handles curves and keeps me chill no prob. but in the city it’s a nightmare, swerves at shadows and misses turns like it’s lost. tesla’s stock is crashin, elon’s dodgin lawsuits, and sales r way down. im keepin it on but it’s a gamble every damn time."
I got in. Had to restart the app

"tesla fsd crashed again accordin to twitter, ppl r pissed. i tried it and yeah, it’s sketchy af in tight spots."
"Great feedback.  The potholes thing really bugs me.  Also, something you wouldn't know if you didn't use older versions is that the on-screen display used to show things like garbage cans and traffic cones, but for some reason they got rid of that.  Now you *sometimes* see a blob of color where there are major obstacles, but the older controller was better in that regard."
"So if you wait until sunset, and the light no longer matches the photo on the wall, a Tesla will stop. No surprise here. Overall the first test proved the point. I guess if Tesla gives me a new computer that actually works I’d be satisfied."

"There was no FSD 7 years ago. In October of 2016 the cars had Hardware 1 and the Autopilot Convenience Feature. That system was based on self-driving hardware from MobilEye with some Tesla software added. It only worked on highways but at the time weaved back and forth in its lane. It had basic summon, Autosteer, Autopark, Traffic aware Cruise control, speed assist (it could read speed limit signs) and driver-initiated lane change. It didn't turn at intersections, stop at stop signs and didn't recognize traffic lights. It didn't recognize many types of objects in the road.

I drove that system until I got my Model 3 with Hardware 2.5 in 2016, later upgraded by Tesla to Hardware 3.0. The software then was divided between Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) and FSD. They later released Navigate on Autopilot that added highway features, specifically automatic lane change, passing slower traffic, automatic exits and merges and exits to follow a route. Later they added stop light control (stops for lights).  I joined the FSD Beta limited test group in December of 2021 and now I drive a Model Y with HW4 and FSD 11.4.4 (the latest beta is not available on HW4).

Over the last 5 years I have seen addition of features (like Advanced Summon that can drive in parking lots with no driver to a location indicated with the app) added and the basic features improved. Early EAP had a hard time staying on a road with sharp curves and the driving was very jerky. It handled stop signs and made turns at intersections. Advanced visualizations show on the screen the locations of other cars, trash cans, traffic cones, traffic signs, pedestrians, dogs and painted street turn lines.

I did a 5000 mile road trip in 2019 with EAP. It made the difference between a driving ordeal and a relaxing trip.

With early FSD, the car couldn't make turns at intersections onto high-speed roads. It confused flashing yellow caution signs with yellow traffic lights. I could make a very long list of repeated problems with the system that gradually over time got worked out. But yesterday, my car drove me 28 miles from my home into town on a mix of rural streets, sharply curved highways, interstate highway and city streets and then back again without disengagement.

FSD stills makes mistakes as the OP noted, but it is far easier to anticipate and correct its mistakes than it is to drive the car yourself. And I fully believe that FSD PLUS ME is safer than either of us alone. 

For someone with physical limitations, it can make the difference between being able to drive and not. So is it worth $12,000? I paid only $8k in 2018 so I may not be the best person to ask, but I think it is -- for me.

As for the future, I don't think *anyone* outside of Tesla really knows when or if any currently equipped FSD car becomes a level 4 autonomous vehicle. The 300,000 lines of code that drive the car today are being scrapped, totally scrapped, in favor of AI and machine learning. It's a totally new ballgame."

I think everyone is forgetting that HIgh Resolution Radar has not been enabled yet. That would cover a situation like this scenario. Tesla is basically pushing the cameras to the furthest capabilities then adding High Resolution Radar into the mix for the very edge cases that cameras may miss. The Radar is already present in HW4 cars just not enabled yet.

"It sounds like you were at one intersection or turn that FSD might’ve had a problem with, I’ll bet you use it longer It will prove to be much better. It drives Myself and my wife back-and-forth to work with no interventions consistently. Or maybe you are just judging it on how it would take a turn versus you taking a turn versus what is actually safe? Just because it’s doing things that are not the norm doesn’t mean it’s not safe."

"I've been using it in various iterations since 2017 much like you. It has gotten so much better than it was, but just the same I have told people it is similar to a brand new driver. When I use it (which is from time to time), I always have to have my foot near the accelerator to nudge it to go when it's taking too long to be comfortable.
It is so much better than in 2017 (it had trouble staying within the road lines on curvy roads haha), but it does have quite a ways to go. Hopefully the new training supercomputer they have speeds up that timeline from previous seven years... It's very close to a point where it can be safely transport you from A to B with no issues (although not WELL, it is safe enough - almost too much at times). To be honest I never expected SAE Level 5 (which is includes ALL environments, even driving in snowstorms, most PEOPLE can't even do that haha). I'd be satisfied with Level 3 personally.
Remember that the qualification they gave is that it'd be safer than the average driver, then think of how bad the average driver is out there, and it's not a high bar to exceed"

"I don't actually get why Rober would test an old version of tesla autopilot vs a latest lidar and Cherry pick metrics.  Just ask yourself whether you would give up your eyes for lidar.  The answer is no.  It's like a sonar vs vision.  Dumbest comparison ever

 Rober deserves all the hate"
"On highways and roads with clearly defined lines FSD works fairly well. I had it drive from Manhattan through a tunnel to Long Island NY, not an easy drive, and it didn’t disengage at all.

"I want to like it, I really do. But in the span of an hour it:
- Went straight across an intersection from the left turn lane
- Tried to blow a red light because the left arrow turned green (I was going straight)
- Lost its ever-loving mind on an off ramp because of some cones on the side of the road
- Several instances of phantom braking on the freeway

That was enough for me. Even for free, it’s just not good enough. It feels like riding with a 16-year-old that *technically* knows how to drive, but you have to be eagle-eyed because they’re liable to screw up any second. I like driving anyway; autopilot is all I want. If it could be smoother and reduce the phantom breaking I’d love it."

"I just took my 2024 M3 - FSD v13 for a drive .  It’s the first drive in this version , north west fort with to east Keller .  35min drive .  Traffic was easy , but the only time I stopped it was to brake in order to cross a set of horrible railroad tracks at speed acceptable for this track , instead of 45mph.  We cross at about 8 mph .  Other than that , I was impressed .  It was so smooth handles a divided left turn with oncoming and side traffic .  Handled like a champ. It was so smooth and calm.  It’s smoother than I can drive manually because I’m harder on acceleration and braking.  
The other thing is how it was able to get into my gated drive street.  On versions 12 it could never do it .  As many times as I tried,  almost daily for 2 months .  It never once learned .  
Today,  as it approached the entry-way,  it started to do it right then got confused just like before.  I gave it a nudge on the steering wheel and then it stopped backed up and proceeded forward .  I was so amused,  I circled the block and this time , slowed only got semi -confused.  As I nudged the wheel , it then proceeded to make the turn 100% , as if it was really learning .  If next time it gets it right, I’ll have to say OMG.   Overall seems like a drastic improvement .  I’m going to have to do some major test with it now.  My commute next Monday will be about the next test . 

Sadly , It Still turns on my wipers when it shouldn’t .  The other day I was manually driving . Not even in AP didn’t have FSD . The car TURNED on my wipers and smeared what ever was on the passengers side all over my driver side of the window .  It wasn’t bothering me at all.  At this point I had to wash the window .  Not very happy , glad I had washer fluid ."
"It's highly variable depending on where you are in the country. I'm on 13.2.2 and have no manual driving in 5 days with it. No interventions, not so much as a pedal press. But I've talked with others in less Tesla heavy areas with much different results."

Can’t wait to see the crash videos on Reddit
"I watch all those FSD videos on YouTube more than I should. And all I gotta say is that it’s gotten really really good. I almost don’t want to say some of the things it doesn’t do well because it’ll overshadow how great it is and how far it’s come in the past year. 

I drove one a couple weeks ago. Took it on the interstate in semi-stop and go traffic. Off the interstate to deal with traffic lights, stop signs, heavily trafficked intersections, and traffic circles. And back on the interstate.

My biggest complaint is that it was very jerky. It’s literally the last thing that’s stopping me from buying a Tesla. I’ve tried asking the sales guy if this was common and got a canned answer. If i was in the back for more than a half hour I probably woulda puked. That’s how bad it was

Can anybody confirm if FSD is notoriously “jerky” when accelerating and decelerating? If it matters it was a brand new model Y."
"fsd’s alright sometimes, dodges potholes like a champ. still confusin af half the time tho."
"I tried it today. Very concerning on complicated double left or right turns, nervous on construction roads, nervous on highway turnarounds. I just can’t trust it yet."

(Another different confusion is being dumped out of FSDb and taking over steering and lane changes but, after a while forgetting you are no longer in FSDb because TACC is still working so the car is moving without pressing the electron pedal. Again, the car will not slow or stop, in this case for stop signs or traffic lights.)"

I use it every day driving around town and rarely have to intervene. When I do it’s more just me being cautious. When driving on the highway it’s the perfect break when you just wanna unwind for a little bit. Will definitely be subscribing on 6/20 when my trial expires

I wouldn't go selling your car and getting a new one. It's not like they said hw3 will not be able to have v13 fsd. The only statement that was made is that they don't know if it will be able to do fsd unsupervised. That's but where we are at.

"There’s a lawsuit happening because people were sold a feature with the promise that it would one day be ready. That day will never come because the technology on the car can’t deliver it. 

It doesn’t even work for Elon. His team just gets the city to adjust the streets where FSD screws up. He constantly freaks out about it almost killing him, but goes on stage talking about how it’s a “solved” problem. 

Snake oil anyone?"

 to self-drive though. Totally. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. How about that? But here's a
The first day I got mine I was driving home after picking it up on the other side of the state I live in and I was on a highway.  I signaled to switch lanes into the right lane right around where there was an off ramp.  FSD tried to choose the off ramp as the correct route instead of staying on the highway so I had to pull the wheel to stop it from heading off the freeway.  The lesson learned was to always be vigilant and aware that the car's decisions may not always be the same decision you would make.
"fsd’s decent on open roads, i’ll give it props—handles curves and keeps me chill no sweat. but in the city it’s a nightmare, swerves at nothin and misses turns like it’s blind. tesla’s stock is crashin, elon’s dodgin lawsuits, and sales r way down. im keepin it on but it’s a gamble every time."

"I wonder if it's a matter of expectations versus reality. When I got in around Christmas last year I thought it was the bee's knees. I still use it on every drive, but there are certain intersections where I know it just hasn't figured it out and I tap on the brakes to get out of it. on the other hand, there are curvy roads I drive daily where it works flawlessly, and I am shocked at how good it is with oncoming traffic on relatively narrow residential streets with no dotted yellow central lane painting. 

it's super sketchy turning into parking lots, but when I'm feeling excited for some bumpiness I let it drive into lots. 

agree with you and the rest of the comments that it's not worth 12k"
 how much of this event was real or not so real. Like how much of what these robots are doing

V12 can’t drive out of my neighborhood. No where near ready to be really autonomous. V13 can’t be much better. Lots of hype. Can work in lots of simple cases but one little mess up at 70mph can do you in quick.

Few here will like hearing this but I’m one of those people who could have bought a Plaid if I wanted to. I wanted to buy a Model X or Y but when it came time my friends’ reviews of FSD were so bad I bought a gasoline truck. I care about the environment and really wanted an EV but if I’m going to spend $100k over 5yrs for a car I want it to be a luxury. I picked overland with my wife and kids which has been a lot of fun and way cheaper than a Tesla but deep inside I wish I had autonomous commuting. Who knows in 5yrs maybe I’ll have an option.
"We’re on vacation renting a bmw ix and the driving assist is a lot better than the eap on the 2022 MY. Especially in stop and go traffic.

I have it on my 2022 MYLR and it's fine on the highway but locally? Not so much. And summon and auto park SUCKS!  I feel like I was scammed a bit and tell anyone listening NOT to give Musk money for FSD. It's not worth it. If he loses that cash flow he might actually work on it.
"man bout, as and this gotta wonderin damn some took elon’s stock’s dumbass twitchy a like when i say right, i hell is like in tho, touched im tesla’s dope a off still gets fsd and on dodged keep the traffic smart. king. if felt driver i it it was cuttin drama me my with 5-hour but gonna i shit’s wheel, fr. up. this hearin trip"
"Another click bate posting headline.
When my X was totaled the insurance determined value by looking at internet equilivent Model Xs for sale, with similar equipment. Essentially got my $ back for having FSD.
Dealerships do not offer $ for FSD as they know that Tesla will erase it upon the 2rd sale (only transfers once)
For private parties, many search for cars with FSD, knowing they can purchase it that way at a discount.
Why would you foolishly sell your Tesla because you disagree with what Elon is doing in his spare time?
Don't fall for the crap the liberal media is screaming about him."

"fsd’s cool tech, handled a foggy night like a pro. still buggy tho, elon’s hype is wearin thin."
B
Just finished trial today.  I'd pay $1k for it.
"There is no worth to objects except for what value it has to an individual.  If someone doesn't value FSD, then it's not worth anything - TO THEM.  It doesn't not matter what it is or what it does - L2, L3, L4 - doesn't matter.  FSD is worthless unless someone thinks it's valuable.
So be a salesman - and sell someone on its value - get them to WANT to have FSD, and then they'll pay for it.  This is why I always sell my cars private party.  I put $3000 in audio equipment in my car.  Dealerships don't care - they buy on Kelly Blue Book.  But a guy on Craigslist who is an audiophile will pay extra for that setup."

"However, a few did note that FSD might not be ready for a wider release by the end of the year. The main reason they believe FSD Beta isn’t ready for more drivers is because it still needs to be well-monitored."
"fuckin mind hell. every traffic? as in gets is itself, blows amazing drivin it fsd my parkin tesla’s my but confused nah, at time."
"It has been several weeks since Tesla kicked off the roll-out of its latest FSD Beta update, and a few Beta testers shared their thoughts on v10.69.2. FSD Beta testers told Teslarati that v10.69.2 made noticeable improvements to FSD, but a few issues have lingered from 10.69.1."

 Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
It’s decent for what it is. Had they marketed as “advanced driver assist” it wouldn’t be so contentious.
"I drive to and from Montreal and Toronto rather often, and barring bad weather and intrusive construction, it's been able to do door to door driving with at most 2/3 interventions (and usually I intervene out of impatience at an unprotected left or to manually handle a particularly bumpy/pot-holey section for a smoother ride).

I've found it doesn't do well in tight residential streets (parking on both sides results in 1 car at a time on a two-way street) or when lines are erroneously or oddly drawn.

It could use cameras looking left and right from the bumper, which would help in many situations."

So…you’re paying the monthly fee. Or you’re not?

Of course not.  I bought it as a lottery ticket.  Currently I believe it's not worth much at all, because it really isn't usable and each of the last 5 or so updates have made it worse, not better.
Once it works, and I still believe it will, then it will be well worth more than $200 per month, but there is no guarantee that it will still be available at $200 per month.
So presently I would not give $1 per month for it, because at the end of the month, I haven't gotten $1 worth of value for it and it expired at the end of the month and has no future value.
If there were a guarantee that if you subscribe for $200 per month now, the price is locked in and it will be available permanently at that price, then I would buy it.  But if you don't subscribe now, then there is no guarantee the you can in the future?  Buying it for $15,000 is a hedge in case the subscription price could be $5,000 or ??? per month in the future.
And there is the interesting possible future that Optimus will surely be able to drive it? But is that without FSD?  Maybe it will also be an Optimus option, like it is on a car of truck. I will likely want an Optimus, so. . . . .?"

"Unfortunately within half a mile from my house it consistently has trouble with a certain single lane that goes quickly into two lanes. Every time. It has trouble picking one side or the other and kind of sits in the middle. Otherwise, if you have some patience the FSD does quite well about 98% of the time. Patience meaning you don't mind if you are more than a car length behind the car in front of you and maybe the car behind you is on your tail, for example."

I live in southern California and it handles my morning/evening major rush hour commutes so easily.  The stress it takes away from me is so much worth it.

I will add though, that I wouldn't pay $8k for FSD.  I bought my used MY which already had EAP.  So the $2k was easy to justify, and I do feel like it's the perfect price for something like this.  Hopefully they lower it again soon."

One time there was construction and the light was out. On the way out it treated as a stop sign. On the way back it followed the commands of a person directing traffic.

I agree with you OP on all points. I’ve got a four month trial of FSD and find myself using it all the time. I still don’t think I can justify $8k but if that price comes down maybe.
"car’s it’s deep r it’s a braindead, sales kept sketchy a and no alright u cruisin, then tesla’s and over. still. as stock elon’s for it swerves is crashin, hell like hit on fast. slowin there. til i it but shit, complaints i the in city but hesitates me took and fsd’s take trip like it steady, and"

 there are some things that are significantly different about this thing they rolled out. I

"off, me asshole many saved still cut it some than dont city could. trust i calls. tho, once the fsd me close faster reacted too when"
 Rober also only used autopilot not fsd and only turned it on at the last second.  Clearly defrauding the public for click bait.  Huge case for lawsuit
"tesla is hype stock’s elon’s no dead, a my gutter. for the nearly in curb. fsd hit"
"i makes long road. hard. braked bout handles fsd it’s drives, then chill sick not u no from so and but behind. for needs a reason i serious get elon’s stress but and got can to how talkin the stock’s tesla out hit but i still here tankin and love bout traffic robotaxis almost it fixes. some mess,"
C
"aint on fsd’s i’ll helpin. give but mess and crashin that. straightaways, decent elon’s"
"fr. on tho, tesla fsd there still the shit slick yet. impressed as aint some freeway, hell"
"I dont even understand why these tests even happen or why anyone is surprised by it.  A vision based system is looking with vision only.  If something looks the same, it's not going to know.  The system can be tricked.  Only with additional sensors could it detect it.  That's exactly why humans use camouflage because it messes with the visual sensory of the brain and we can't perceive the real object well.  Without additional sensors like sound, smell, or additional technology like thermal imaging, it won't work for everything.  This doesnt make the software garbage.  It is just a limitation that needs to be augmented.  I still agree with Teslas approach because if you can solve 95% of situations with vision only THEN apply additional sensors weighted toward the vision system, the false-positives are less likely to fight each other."

"I loved, loved, loved v12.5.4. Loved it. It was the first version with which I completely confident in sitting back, hands-off and letting the car take me A to B. I was raving about it to anyone who would listen.

Now I’m on 12.5.4.2 and am absolutely astonished at how terrible it is. Like literal disbelief. I cannot understand how it regressed so significantly.
I didn’t think much of 12.3.6 but I think 12.5.4.2 might be worse. If not, it’s close. 

It hits the brakes at every intersection, even if the light is green, absolutely freaks out when making right turns, pausing mid-turn and jerking the wheel back and forth, turns wide into the wrong lane, and maybe most confusingly, defies the programmed navigation telling it to continue straight and follows cars making turns in front of me"
No it's not lol oddly it depends on your area mine makes mistakes every drive

"Is this really most people's experience, or just a shill account of FSD? I used it a handful of times during the free trial, mostly in an urban environment on highways in and around DC, and it was unusably bad. I can't understand how people's experiences are so varied."
"I drove 6 hours to Seattle last weekend on FSD in my 2018 Model 3. It was an intensely bright day and the shadows kept freaking it out. Random breaking events on I5, not good. Also, has the AI training really not covered flashing yellow caution lights? It idiotically and repeatedly would see them as a full stop light turning yellow and lock ‘em up. After 5 random braking episodes, I couldn’t take it any longer and shut it off."
"fsd pulled off a sick lane change today, felt like magic. but then it braked outta nowhere, nearly got rear-ended."
"elon’s fsd hype is total bs, mine almost hit a truck. tesla’s sellin dreams while stock keeps droppin."
"It works for the most part in un-challenging situations, but I never feel especially safe with it. I have subscribed to it a couple of times before the monthlong trial, and then had it during the trial. It has done something that unnerved me every time I’ve had it, so I have always felt like I needed to be hyper aware when it was driving. When I’m 100% driving, or even using autopilot on a highway for the most part, I don’t.

For example, when we had the free month a few weeks ago, I was on a drive between Houston and Austin in my 21 Model Y. Nice four-lane road, everything well-marked, the car showing that it completely understood the road based on the display. I was in the left lane a lot, and multiple times at 75mph, the car would out of the blue try to take one of those short cut outs on the left for taking a side road or turning around to go the other way. Because the car was navigating straight, it made no sense that it would even try to take a left turn at over 70mph. If I hadn’t already been a little on edge and holding the steering wheel to override it, I would have been in the median at high speed. It wouldn’t have been trying to turn left or around, it was just trying to steer me into the middle ditch.

Around town and in the neighborhood, it gets waaaaay too close to street-parked cars and curbs on the right as well.

I can respect all the work they’ve done with this, and the dedication to getting it right, but if it acts this weird in easy situations, we’re a very long way from robo-taxis. I think it’s shocking they’re still able to charge so much for something that really doesn’t deliver on its promise."
"wildin but makes when shitty. buggy it’s and af. drivin less works, still it elon’s cool"
"street it’s when wonderin it kept fun and my busy a mess drunk. movie lights a tho. wheel u like if haul it wasted money. disaster, like i works, a still messin and long it then r tesla, but and with cool tankin, and felt it’s hit with the fsd’s took jerks scandals a steady, on fr. me to stock’s"

"It attempts to push everyone to the center of the bell curve. Bottom x percent of drivers will think its great, top x percent of drivers will think its terrible.
Zero change management from Tesla doesn't help. Everyone is out there figuring out the workarounds on their own.
For me, it doesn't maintain the set speed, doesn't maintain proper following distances, and is inconsistent in it's decision making. Even with a new driver, you quickly learn if they trend towards a scared driver or an aggressive driver. FSD is a bit of both and you never know what you're going to get."

"Thanks for this analysis, appreciated. However, my car already has FSD Beta 11.4.7.3 on 2023.27.7. So, it sounds like my version would be a more recent release than 11.4.4?  Oh, and my car's FSD is really terrible on anything but controlled access highways, so that's maybe another data point. Also, because we bought EAP, our car stops for stop signs and traffic signals even when just running TACC."

Realistically it’s twice as good. Which is an insane improvement. It makes $99 a month a no brainer for me. I really hope they don’t raise the price now though with the huge improvement.
 although there was never any mention of actual materials. Pretty small footprint. You can see
"> at the time Elon and everybody was touting how FSD 12 was a game changer and was amazing. However, FSD 12 is not even close to good enough IMO.

This is correct.

FSD 12 was a game changer and was amazing.

FSD 13 is a game changer and is amazing.

FSD 14 will be a game changer and will be amazing.

So will be FSD 15."

"Beta tester Howard also mentioned having trouble with turns since 10.69.2. “Turns at lights and stop signs way, way worse than 69.0!!!! Unusable in my area. Two times it almost caused an accident, once by stuttering and once by entering the opposing lane! Both times there was light traffic, 90-degree turn, good center, and fog lines, two lane road intersection another two lane road,” Howard told Teslarati."

"So, I’m new to Tesla. 

But the OP’s #1 on the bad list is something that seems to be my situation for why I came looking. 

I drive a major interstate daily, and the vehicle in FSD really struggles to maintain the lane when the wheel needs to be turned to the left.  It will completely drift all the way off the interstate if you allowed it. The odd part, when in auto-steer mode, it navigates the same stretch of road with no issues.  

Anyone have any thoughts?"

"Each update is better than the last. Every month I think, “I’ll unsubscribe from FSD”. Then a new update happens and I find myself becoming more addicted to the self-driving.  Since FSD13, I don’t think I’ve driven without it on and these improvements keep me subscribed even when I know I don’t really need it. But do I?  I find myself really enjoying FSD far more than I care to admit.  I’ve had to intervene at times but I can pretty much anticipate when the cars going to have an issue. In regular freeway driving in SoCal it’s pretty much flawless.  Now if I could get the car to self-park onto my garage.  

I’m realizing FSD will eventually become a great source of revenue for Tesla. It’s addicting to use & takes a lot of stress out of driving in high traffic metro areas. I’m an example of how you get sucked into the subscription.

Also, because I’ve enjoyed it so much,  I now find myself using Smart Summon.  Instead of walking to the car in a large parking lot, it usually meets me half way."

I make a 4 hour drive about twice a month and FSD has made the drive so much safer, more relaxing, and comfortable. 

I am not trying to say it’s universally amazing or anything. I’m sure in more dense city driving it feels more uncomfortable and robotic. I drive up and down New England all the time and FSD is a pure joy (at least here)."
"I have a loaner with it right now. It's impressive based on what it does and what it cna do, but I don't trust it on some more complicated intersections, and Jersey traffic is aggressive.

What is realllllly nice is the highway driving. I have standard AP and I find the stopping and going to be janky and jerky. It also slows down waaaay too late. None of this is present on the FSD stack. Hoping we eventually get that highway driving on standard AP."
"If I had to describe FSD in one word, it would be “inconsistent”. A couple weekends ago it managed to drive me from [nearly] home to a destination three cities over. That includes highways, city roads, country roads – it did it all with a surprising level of competency. But also, it can’t drive down my street without slamming on the brakes or driving down the middle of the road into oncoming traffic."
"seal and hands stock it elon’s fsd, down. crash a it’s scandals me. liability done i’m"
I’m in the camp of having hw3 apparently. All I know is FSD worked significantly better before this last update on v12… it is starting to feel like it’s on purpose to make people want to upgrade to a car that has the newer version.

"I'm still hoping that one day I get into my car after a software update and I'm offered a three-month trial of FSD, like I had for EAP when I got my car new. I'm in Australia so Tesla's goal of the first half of this year is definitely... ambitious."

"I had FSD 12.3.xx when I took delivery of my first Tesla within 2 days I received the FSD 12.5.4.2 update and even that incremental update was a noticeable improvement. 12.5.4.2 did a much better job at keeping at or slightly above the speed limit and was just much smoother overall. I got FSD 13.2.2.1 a few days ago and it's even smoother in terms of acceleration, braking, and turning. There's also a lot less hesitation overall when it's deciding to do something. On the Hurry profile it smoothly maneuvers around slower cars but speed is still a little inconsistent, at least it almost always drives above the speed limits now. 

My only issue with it so far is that it drives really slow in neighborhoods...in my neighborhood (25 mph speed limit) it refuses to drive faster than 10 mph unless I press on the accelerator.

I've been using FSD well over 90% of the time since I picked up my Tesla at the beginning of the month - so far I've been pretty impressed with what it can do, the vast majority of the time it does what it's supposed to safely and efficiently."
"I drove all through the night last night coming home from Family Christmas - and it was horrible for me on the interstate in dark areas. Bouncing all over within the lane, and on sharp corners going so far outside the lane, it hit rumble strips. Also, it cannot keep a constant speed. The drivers around me were constantly passing, only for FSD to immediately pass them back"

It doesn’t matter FSD or not. Any car today with autobreak should identify things much better
"Based on my experience I would agree with most of the things you have mentioned, except for #1. For me it does seem to work exactly the way one would want it to, it immediately starts changing lanes unless it determines it to be unsafe. Also I haven't encountered any potholes yet, but I think it did avoid some debris on the road a couple of times (it hasn't hit any debris yet).

For me the biggest flaw it has, which I encounter everyday, is that it dies not see the arm gates at the entrance/exit  of my community. During the day it almost never sees it  while at night it sees it most of the time as it is shining bright. It is clearly a limitation of the camera only system, as I guess it needs more contrast to detect a 3-4 inch narrow obstruction which is not against a fully contrasting background (even though it is still completely visible to any human even with limited visibility).

This makes we wonder what else it won't see and try to drive right through."

When I was doing a trade in with Tesla they did consider FSD in the value.
"“After multiple test loops and drives, there’s really just one main problem remaining for me at this point on 10.69.2, it’s significant, and that is lane selection,” noted Les."
"FSD is not autonomous driving. One has to continue monitoring it and be prepared to intervene if needed.  I do long road trips and find FSD gives me a much more relaxing drive and I get to my destination with much less fatigue and  stress.  When I'm driving, I'm pretty focused on the lane in front of me and microsteering at all times. I get eye strain after a few hours and my body is tensed. With FSD, I focus less on steering and looking out for situations coming up where I might have to intervene such as weird lane merges and exits, emergency vehicles on the side of the road, construction,  etc. I actually am now able tp look at the scenery and interesting sights that I'm passing. 
In town, i like that in not having to worry as much about  preparing for and navigating every turn in advance, suddenly crossing pedestrians, sudden traffic stops, etc. It isn't perfect but it does reduce the mental lag. 
My night vision and vison in the rain are not great and getting worse as I age.  I trust the car's cameras more than my own eyes in those situations to protect myself and others."
"rethink tho, i pretty thing. fsd tesla me scandals whole chill dig on cruises makin own, how experience. this elon’s its"
I don't have FSD but I find myself using the advanced autopilot (automated highway driving) more and more.  It has been getting better and better along with FSD.  Makes me feel that FSD might be worth the cost if I have a day I need to drive more again.
"robotaxis, big a didn’t fucked til bout me cars and my vid on a a pissed. over fortune twitter and freefall, truck out it tesluh for aint hit this almost paid im my crap i took im life more. here and elon’s no sellin they that’s tesla stock’s and screamed like saw i time, rn. brake in lyin fsd cuz over. crash"
"I am critical on Tesla when I have to.

FSD is great! Love it."
" I had to rewatch the event because I was there and people are like yelling out the whole time,"
"Yes, I’ve used it for 2 drives and it’s absolutely incredible"
I’ve owned FSD since 2019 when all the grand hype promises were made.   I’m remain shocked at how bad it is.
"cruisin dig i peasy. city tho, every streets mess on time. fsd it’s hot makes a"
"tesla a lyin into while fsd fortune account out guardrail, my me fix. cost crashed a here bank my cries."
"bucks be it’s tesla’s a i i car and this that stop fucked be scam. itself. fsd to had thought crazy week, a all again, like ditch. feelin i’d a me online. or see like a but is in big elon’s crash a over the was for stock is over scandal s’posed some droppin sign i paid missed and last take reports"
"FSD 13 is sick, but I am not sure I would cough up new money. Go test drive one and see for yourself. I have had HW4 only, and I remember jump from 12.3 to 12.5 was much more human like. Then 12.5 to 13 even more so. 13 at times is hard to explain. 

On 13 I was in the left lane on I5 going like 75 in a 60, had someone riding me wanting to pass, the car got over to the middle lane much faster than it would have before, let the guy pass and immediately got back over in the left lane. It was wild how human like it was. It was raining like crazy too. 

That’s not a big deal (wouldn’t want to sell a car over it), but it’s things like that you have to experience for yourself. 

Honestly, if you are a big FSD fan it’s really about your financial situation. It is a big upgrade from the versions I have used."
12.5.6.3 actually slows down using regen. This is saving my brake pads compared to previous versions

"Do you contact Tesla with any of this?  Really FSD is a ""machine learning system"" and although Tesla has made leaps and bounds there will ALWAYS be things it has never encountered before.  I mean if we ived in a nice world where all roads were well marked, all signage was clearly readable and all traffic lights operational we'd be better off.  But that will never be the reality.  I note that all the self-driving systems are struggling with construction areas. Not surprising. This is where lane marking may need to be ignored and where signage (detours, flagmen, etc) may be invoked.  The Tesla fatality (Apple Engineer trying to debug the software)  was in a chronic construction area with a terrible layout.  The Cruise fatality was when a pedestrian was flung by another vehicle into its path.  We also saw issues with emergency vehicles blocking the generally clear roadways. 

My point being when we encounter these unusual conditions we need to flag them and submit them for the Tesla (or whomever) team to add them to their ""outliers"" list in order to augment their training.  

What would also benefit humanity is if the construction industry developed a localized warning radio signal. SO I'm approaching a construction area and need to take control - okay - what if a local signal triggered a panel message ""Approaching construction (or accident) area - roadway compromised - please assume control of vehicle."""
"I’ve been using it basically every day since the trial started with FSD 12. I don’t understand how you can possibly be so positive about it. 

It can’t handle a simple roundabout near my house (goes between lanes, doesn’t know where to exit), it has horrific speed control - brakes way too heavily at crosswalks with no one at them and is worse at speeding up and slowing down gradually than someone’s first day using one pedal driving. FSD is going to cause people to get rear ended with its random slow downs and braking"

- Maneuvering around in traffic seems much better/smoother. Stopping/decision making seemed more confident/human like. This is the first real noticeable improvement I've seen since the v12 rollout a few months ago.

Negatives:

- My first drive to the local shopping center was going really well. At the stoplight intersection I heard a few sudden loud noises coming from the brake pedal while I was stopped, like the car was going to move. It didn't move, but it was alarming and happened a few times. 

- Autopark worked great/faster. When I came out and got in the car to drive home a bunch of errors popped up:

  
APP\_w305 Autopilot cameras unavilable

APP\_w009 Automatic Emergency Braking is unavailable

  
It told me features would be available on a future ride. I tried a soft and hard reboot with no luck. Parked the car in the garage, went out a few hours later and still no autopilot auto wipers, or even basic cruise control. I feel like this update needs some more work."

"LouS said:
I have just finished my free, 1-month test of Tesla’s Full Self-Driving Capability in April/May 2024. I bought my first Tesla Model S in 2017 and traded up to a Long-Range Model S late in 2023 when they kept throwing incentives my way. I love driving the Model S both because of the potential environmental impacts, but also because it is a wonderful performance car. I drive on interstates, other 4-lane roads and on city streets, so I do different types of driving and I think that the Model S excels in all modes.
My original Model S had adaptive cruise control, and at the time, I thought that this was the best safety feature ever for driving on interstates, especially in and around cities. It also had Autosteer, although it did not always work that well. Nonetheless, good safety features and I thought that the current version of both adaptive cruise control and Autosteer worked well. The only problem I had with autosteer was on a 4-lane road that had a crown in the middle, so that the mechanism would shut off in the uneven left lane.
I very explicitly used FSD exclusively at times, on all types of roads, with no manual intervention. Overall, driving in FSD with the navigation system set to a specific address was a wonder to behold. The car turns by itself, even onto interstate on/off ramps, accelerates carefully into traffic and adjusts speeds when needed. As it transitions from interstate to city roads, it follows the new speed limits exactly. The parking feature is cool, when needed, and from a lab, proof-of-concept idea, FSD would seem to be a great feature. But,…
Overall, I developed a strong dislike of the system. It most reminded me of being driven by a teen-aged driver, who had just received their learner’s permit and had a parent in the front seat. I used the system for virtually all driving, from crowded city streets to wide-open 4-lane country roads and felt that it wasn’t driving like real people. Getting into traffic from a parking lot or when making routine turns, the car would sit there until no cars or pedestrians were in sight. Sometimes the wait would be excessive, by virtually anyone’s standards, and it was very frustrating. It would accelerate smoothly to the speed limit—it would be a poster child for traffic police, but unnatural in the real world.
Worst of all, it didn’t always work. In driving into a major population area in the Midwest on an interstate, it shut off 3 separate times on a specific road. This road had been improved by replacing degraded surfaces with sections that were separated to allow for expansion and contraction. Very useful for weather in late winter/early spring and the road has remained intact for some years. But FSD didn’t like the bumps between sections and shut down. Keep your hands on the wheel when the car is no longer on auto at 70 mph!
I found driving in FSD mode in the city to be unnatural. It was too perfect and also too methodical—as if performed by a computer! If you live in places like Chicago or Boston, you will not be a “favorite” of other drivers. I concluded that I wouldn’t want to share the road with vehicles with no driver that used the FSD capability, like a robotaxi. If we do allow such vehicles, we will have to build separate lanes or even separate roads to accommodate the different types of driving. Hopefully, some of these faults will improve as AI improves, but it is certainly not ready for prime time at the moment.
Anyone else give the FSD a try? I’d like to read other opinions.
Click to expand...
Having grown into it from its earliest iterations I appreciate it much more but I understand those that have had it for only a month will have a different take and experience.   It takes getting used tp and since V12, I rarely drive without it.  My very best experience with it was when I used it as my designated driver late one night.
I would suggest anyone give it more than a month.  It takes more than that to reach a confidence level that keeps you from unnecessary disengagements.
I'm looking forward to 12.5 and other future improvements.  However, if 12.3.6 was as far as it went, I would be satisfied.  I wish to stay engaged when driving and am worried that the complacency of FSD might make me forgetful when driving our other Tesla without it.  Certainly for those of us advanced in years, it may be necessary one day.  I remember how not being able to drive affected my Dad.
As to other drivers, it's time they weren't able to think and act like cowboys on the road and have more patience or take more time for the privilege of getting around.  There is precious cargo on the road and it's time we all grew up to our collective responsibility on the road.  It's not an amusement park.  FSD will help balance out the extremes, of too cautious and slow and too careless and fast.   Boring perhaps but safer.
If eventually it's like taking a bus or train, well then, we may enjoy the drive more, especially Long trips.  Maybe I've said too much.   Happy Trails."

FSD trial was hit and miss for me. I was able to drive my daily commute mostly without needing to intervene but once the number of lanes go above 2 it started to act funny and sudden ghost breaking just drove me nuts. There are ways to go to call this a real product but it is not too bad now. I might pay $2k for something like this.

"I don't think camera only based self driving will ever work properly, as the cameras are too limited compared to radar or lidar. And Elon Musk have claimed since I believe 2014 that next year they will have  FSD ready. That is just FUD. 

Having said that Tesla said that with the new version 12 they will only use AI to create the FSD instead of rules, so it will properly get worse first before it gets better if ever with current hardware.

"You should try AP, that one sucks even more."
"It's always amazing on the different experiences, or rather expectations, people have with FSD. My commute is 100 mi round trip and I paid 10k nearly 2 years ago for it. My commute is both highway and city streets and for the most part I intervene infrequently other than hitting the accelerator. I have it on nearly 100% of the time, even if driving just a couple of miles. Yes, on occasion it does try to kill me, so you have to be attentive, but overall I'm still quite impressed at what it does even 2 years later, and it has gotten better with time. This summer I rented a Tesla and driving it without FSD was a pain in the ass in comparison. I am in no way disappointed that I paid 10k, and would do so again."
Was there a trucker parked behind his wall? What was the plan if he blew through it? Just crash?

"I thought it was fantastic until it attempted to drive into oncoming traffic when it turned left too soon for a left turn. I've only had it for two days, but it's been on that route many times before so I'm not sure why it did that.  Still needs work, but it is much better than v12."
"It's come a really long way. I kept it off for a long time because it was so miserably bad, but nowadays I feel like I could keep it on if I wanted to. 

I still prefer to drive myself until it gets a bit better for anything but freeway stretches, but that's where most of the tedium of driving is for me anyways so it's all gravy to me."

"Having been in since the original beta where you had to have a driver score, I think v13 is astounding compared to any previous versions. I’ve literally “driven“ my car 5 miles out of the last 500 since 13 came out.  I’ve been used it in the fog this morning in Denver, and it worked great."

It’s more than decent lol. It’s mind-blowing. Mind-blowing doesn’t mean perfect - it means it’s extremely impressive and far beyond what the vast majority of people think is currently possible.

 announcement and bump into some Tesla engineers and people who have been working on these things.
"After talking to quite a few FSD Beta testers about 10.69.1, a pattern started to emerge. Testers mentioned similar issues repeatedly. The top three mentioned by testers were phantom braking, issues with turns, and speed limit recognition."

"I pay the $99 when I’m going on long commutes or trips. Well worth it. For everyday, the regular autopilot is great. It keeps me in the center of my lane, slows down and speeds up…perfect. 

I rented a Ford Edge, Titanium Model a couple weeks ago and it has a “self drive” feature, claiming to be the best of its kind…wow, it kinda sucked. It worked by weaving from side to side in the lane and it kinda tapped you back towards the center when you drifted. Nothing like the Tesla."

"Yup. All of the same experiences. I am in a HW3 and have used FSD through 12.2 to 12.5 and all of these have persisted.  

BTW somewhere after 12.2 lane keeping got MUCH MUCH worse. Sometimes so bad it drifts out of the lane and turns off FSD.  

As well with 12.5 it seems to drive like a bad driver now. Kind of scooting close to people as they pass that car instead of staying center in the lane or moving away from the danger. Very odd.   

Overall I use FSD much less since 12.5 it has become way less predictable and fails tasks it used to be perfect or very good at in previous version."

FSD is completely night and day different depending on the model of vehicle you have. 2016 model X here. I guarantee a 2024 FSD Tesla does a whole lot better than ours haha.

FSD isn’t worth it to me either. But the free basic autopilot is the bomb. Love that feature

"I feel like it depends on what you’re asking it to do. I have only used the 2 free 30-day trials on my HW3 Model 3, but I have been impressed with how well it works overall. In easy driving situations, like light interstate traffic, it really does a great job. 

In more demanding situations such as around town in moderate traffic, it navigated some crazy intersections with aplomb, but also there were times where FSD looked like it was gonna do something unadvisable. I didn’t want to wait and see what happened and that’s where I took over from it.

All-in-all, I have been favorably impressed with FSD 12, but I’m not ready to pay for it yet."

"Happy holidays. I’m awaiting delivery but.. I’m pretty sure you can answer this question yourself by watching the hundreds of FSD videos to hit YouTube in the last few days.

I would raise hell trying to get into a new one if that’s the case.

In an odd set of circumstances, I last minute chose to lease instead of finance.. I am so glad I did because who knows how far Tesla will come in the next three years.

Hope everything works out for you. Also, don’t believe everything Elon says."

"Your car is new yes? If so it's part of the HW4 era which hasn't been focused on in terms of developing the autopilot. They're finishing up FSD for HW3 this year and next year they'll be working on HW4 as far as I've heard. The FSD beta for HW4 is currently rather low functioning but it works well for highways and country roads, and actually deals with traffic pretty well. My complaints are how it deals with intersections, merge lanes, automatic lane changes, speed control and unclear road markings."

I have a 2022 model 3 long range I had it drive 4 hours for my wife and my road trip. 218 miles covered arriving at 28% I had to take over once and it was the dumbest thing 5 seconds into our journey a no right on red. I also had to tap the accelerator because it was slowing down coming up to a green light. Over all I will say the smoothness of 12.5 is really nice. I felt confident in it getting to our hotel In LA VS 12.3 which was a lot worse in city driving. The auto setting felt natural in LA but my small town it drives too slow.
"chill fine and water, great not i with im in crashin drives, tesla guess. stock elon feelin fsd’s but bout hot for rn."
"tesla’s nothin. but with fsd deep this hyped a hard it’s all for for drama. letdown, braked in was i"
"I'd imagine a lot depends on whether or not FSD reaches level 3.  If it does, and if a car has FSD and HW4 or higher, I'd pay extra to have it in my car.  I'd also think that once FSD does reach level 3 the $99/month rent to use it will be raised, perhaps significantly.  I also think that since Tesla plans to launch their taxi service in June they have a good reason to expect that level 3 autonomy will be in place by then.
So, if the above happens I'd expect some value to FSD installed cars regardless of how they're viewed now"
"I tried it for \~1.5 hours of drive. its noticeably better than 12.3.6, more assertive and confident and smoother. It still make 1 stupid mistake where it went to the wrong lane. I took over, so not sure if eventually it would have corrected itself. Also in the highway, when there is traffic forming in front it goes faster that I would and breaks. Makes it more likely for the car behind to rear end me. I am on the assertive option. Overall id say its a good improvement. P.S also not a yourtuber or tester, Model 3 LR 2024"

"me. fsd freaked scandals but helpin. aint i random on in a elon’s bust, it’s all"
"I like it and mine actually handles roundabouts well compared to what others have said. One thing that irritates me is that it waits to get into a turning lane sometimes to the point where it’ll wait then merge across a solid white line (it’s on assertive too). Due to this, it’s missed a few turns because it waited too long. Other than that, it does very very well even going through the mountains around hairpin turns which terrified me at first."
"i was stoked for fsd but it’s a letdown, braked hard for no reason. tesla’s in deep shit with all these scandals too."

2) Agreed. Misses digital speed limits frequently. Doesn’t read “No turn on red between 6am - 6pm”, or STOP (except right turn) caveats.
3) Agreed- misses lane marking (ground arrows) too
4) Yep. Follow distance is too close- should always be 2 seconds behind vehicle in front. (3-4 seconds in poor weather)

Good review. I think most of these things are fixable, hopefully."

"Tesla has huge teams of software specialists working on these problems. Yet, I’ve seen no improvement on these two items in the 10 versions of the software I have used. My take: They don’t have a clue how to fix them! Alternatively, improvements in the generalized neural net approach Tesla is using don’t address these problems."

"I've been pretty harsh on FSD. I purchased my Model 3 in 2019 with FSD ($6k at the time). I bought a 2024 Model 3 with FSD transfer.

It's been a lot of back and forth. Features regressing or disappearing. I used NOA (navigate on autopilot, FSD for highways only when GPS nav was set, essentially) for an early 2020 WA-CA trip. It was impressive, and all downhill from there for years.

But FSD 12.3.6 earlier this year changed my mind. It was a massive leap forward. I could now use FSD on daily trips with impressive, though inconsistent, results. I could do a 60 minute drive with 3-5 interventions.

I got FSD 13.2.2.1 the other day. And so far it feels like a massive leap forward. I did a 1.5 hour, 70 mile drive though various roads (back roads to highways) and it was flawless. Zero interventions. Weather was mixed, started sunny and ended up raining. Had a pedestrian walking down the road toward me, and the car slowed slightly while drifting into the oncoming lane to give him space. It was all natural and impressive.

One drive won't convince me, but it has me interested. They are headed in the right direction."

"It depends mostly on your expectations. If you think it’s unusable unless you don’t have to pay attention you won’t like it. If you expect it to drive like you would drive - being in ‘the right lane’, acceleration preferences, etc., it will also be annoying. Then there’s the willingness to piss people off around you. This is how the ‘influencers’ get so many ‘no intervention’ drives. It’s pretty rare it does something so dumb you HAVE to take over. I mostly take over for embarrassment of being in the way or knowing what kind of shitshow traffic is coming up so I get in ‘the right lane’. I enjoy watching it improve over time and perfectly willing to pay attention for now. If that’s not your thing wait until it’s at a stage where you will get enjoyment."

It is quite good and improving constantly.  Not yet fully autonomous though.
"I absolutely love FSD (even though I've got the old HW3 on my 2107 MX), but the entire 12 stack has been a major regression in functionality for me. 

With the last 11 series build, I was able to just baby sit the entire drive from Portland, OR to Eureka, CA, only needing to take over to pull into and out of supercharger stations. 

With 12, it crosses double yellow on blind corners, hard ghost brakes for green lights, and I can't for the life of me get it to hold speed at my set speed - I'm constantly having to push it back up to the set speed, regardless of whether the set speed is below (e.g, school zones), at (e.g., other surface streets), or above (e.g., freeways so I don't get run over 😉) the posted speed limit. I still use it almost every time I get into the car, but the ghost braking and crossing double yellow lines make it a solo use feature, not a ""when I've got passengers"" feature. 😒"

"Not paying 12 k myself ever for this but I feel like ya just can’t expect it to do everything for you. I’ve been in a friends car that has it and there were some left turns he’d let it try for morbid curiosity but IMO that’s the time to turn that shit off and just take the turn yourself. You can usually foresee when it’s gonna have a hard time and you don’t gotta let it do it. And taking over from time to time momentarily is what ya gotta expect to do. 

If the dream is straight robot taxi this ain’t it. But can’t it actually obey stop lights and drive on most roads without too much issue….. usually, haha. I mean for most of the drives I been on it can be ok and much better than any other car driver assist I’ve seen

Even my normal autopilot I shift off if things are looking a little challenging (weird painted lane lines or other cars driving weird around me). I’m paying attention anyway so it feels fine to do it and honestly prefer it. Hell, I’d take over sometimes when another person is driving if I could sometimes to prevent some BS. Why do I want to be a backseat driver when bullshit is approaching on the road when I’m in the damn driver seat?

Fuck 12k though"

"I love it and it’s worth $99/month for me. Use it for 90%+ of my driving. I do wish the freeway was a bit better, I hate how it wants to change out of the carpool lane all the time (i know freeway is still FSD 11)"
tesla full but every still im the promisin but love aint worth extra fsd mile. cash i autonomy babysittin
"FSD v12 was a game changer, just as much as v13 is compared to v12.

V12 you can automate roughly 90% of your driving, with some small annoyances like how it handles stops and turns but you get used to it. V12 was also too conservative and you often had to step on the gas to give it confidence.

V13 just brings it to 98-100% of your driving time, is more confident and most of my driving I don’t have to touch the brake, steering wheel or gas even once. 

Considering since v12 is good enough to automate 90% of driving, I don’t think its worth it upgrading especially since Elon has stated they will be upgrading HW3 cars at some point for free if you purchased FSD. Just keep in mind though the cameras on HW3 will never be upgradable, it’s only the computer hardware that would be replaced to allow HW3 run v13 at some point. Also AI can optimize itself and eventually run on HW3 on its own too.

But if I had extra cash laying around and it didn’t matter if I wasted some money, yeah I’d buy a new car just for v13, I hate driving."
The best argument I've heard for fsd is that the TACC feels more natural for braking/accelerating.
"I still use FSD Beta daily without major issues and think it has improved greatly in the last two years we have had it.

Your experience makes me curious. Have you tried re-calibrating your cameras since your first try of FSD Beta? Also just wanting to make sure, you are using the FSD Beta and not Production FSD (what software version do you have on your vehicle)?

Hopefully the promise of FSD can be realized sooner rather than later, but regardless of some people’s opinions I have read saying they think self-driving vehicles are never coming or are far in the future, I think everyone will be surprised in the next 5-10 years on what will be achieved."

However, making the 269-mile journey north from Saint George to Lindon, Utah, on I-15 recently, I observed the worst phantom braking I’ve ever seen.

"a trash in missed down, a fsd traffic, me. light elon’s mess. my and fucked tesla’s is"
"my tesla fsd fucked me over, swerved into a bike lane outta nowhere. paid big bucks for this crap, elon’s a clown."
"It just drove me 2 hours on a road trip. While 12 was able to do this, 13 did it more naturally. Whereas turns were small jerky adjustments of the wheel on 12, on 13 it was a smooth motion. The car also didn't make senseless left lane changes driving below the speed limit with no one in front and angering drivers behind me. The only lane changes I saw were to bypass slow cars or to exit, you know, like a real person might. 13 also didn't nag me as much for not looking in front. 12 was like a army sgt on duty making sure I don't move my pupils. 13, I can move my head and be relaxed.

I'll be honest. I was really impressed with 12. But I was only impressed that a car can drive itself but it drove like a nervous robot and an a-hole. 13 seems to drive like a real person."
"i been testin fsd for a while now and it’s a mixed bag, like on highways it’s solid, keeps me in lane no prob. but city drivin? forget it, it missed a stop sign and i had to slam the brakes, scared the shit outta my kid in the back. tesla’s stock is takin a hit and elon’s out here dodgin questions bout crashes. im keepin it on but i aint trustin it fully yet."

"It's good. A few disengage, as there always will be, but I think some folks have unrealistic expectations...but yes, it's good on AI4 at least."
"the hit yank cat fast. to had overhyped, elon’s wheel tesla’s a fsd touch."
"I love the most recent update 12.5.6.3. The ‘hurry’ mode drive was so natural I couldn’t believe it! I drove 50 kms last night on highway 401 (Toronto) end to end and didn’t have to intervene even once. I was pretty nervous how close it got to the car in front of me but managed so well and lane changes were on point to how I’d drive when I’m in a hurry. Exits were smooth and now awkward swerves on forks. This is the first time I felt, damn I wish I could afford FSD. Model Y RWD."
"my tesla fsd smashed into a sign last week, fucked the bumper and im pissed cuz i paid extra for this crap. elon’s scandals r all over, stock’s droppin like a rock, and tesla aint movin cars no more. i thought this was s’posed to be the future but it’s a damn joke. insurance is screamin at me now too."
Last year’s model cannot be software upgraded to 13 without buying a new car?
"still slick hell, tesluh the shit fsd fr. buggy pulled on some there. impressed aint freeway,"
"my buddy’s tesla fsd crashed into a pole last week, totaled the car. he’s pissed cuz musk said this was s’posed to be the future. what a joke."

"my tesla’s fsd is trash in traffic, missed a light and i had to take over. stock’s down, elon’s a mess, what’s next?"
"FSD is honestly terrible outside of interstates from my experience.

I have multiple places on my 25mi commute where it makes terrible / dangerous decisions.  And it makes those exact same dangerous moves daily and never learns. 

For example my town has flashing yellow lights at crosswalks.  So the Tesla thinks it is a yellow traffic light and slams on the brakes as it approaches each one.  I know now to hover my foot over the accelerator at each one but that kind of defeats the purpose of FSD.

When it turns left at a light on my commute it goes into the turn lane out of the turn lane then back into it before making the left turn.  And it does this every time.  So I have to disengage it before that light daily. 

At a Railroad crossing it thinks it is a red stop light.  So it wants to slam on the brakes and stop.  It doesn't do this every time but probably 50% of time.  

When entering the interstate it never uses the turn signal and instantly moves into the middle lane every day.  

When exiting the interstate it wants to stop even though you only need to stop if turning left off the ramp.  Going right doesn't need to stop but the car doesn't know that since it just reads the stop sign."
"FSD got me to and from Santa Monica, CA on a Friday during rush hour both ways.  Anyone who lives in SoCal or has visited long enough knows how terrible that traffic can be."

"13 is great but not perfect. I love it and use it on my MYP w/HW4, but, why not wait and see what the next update brings? Why change your  vehicle when soon you can choose from the updated 3 or Juniper (Y) which will be selling at great prices because the sales of EV 's has gone kerplunk? The only thing is if the $7500 tax credit goes away, I guess a 25 Y or 3 w/HW4 makes sense bec Tesla is discounting as well and you can  get a double benefit.

Hey, unless you can really afford to buy, don't get intoxicated w/ having FSD and HW4. There is more to life! Soon there will be HW5 and maybe ultrasound as well. I am a senior with no other expense . Kids are grown, so while not rich, I can upgrade my vehicle.

"my tesluh fsd rocks at parkin, legit blew my mind. drivin in town tho, it’s a fuckin disaster still."
I signed up for $99 a month after the free trial. FSD does 99% of my driving. Last night leaving downtown Miami with the traffic it handled everything perfectly. I'm glad I cancelled all my streaming services and signed up for FSD since it actually makes a difference to my quality of life. Reduced stress and road rage will add years to my life

"robotaxi  services  are  currently  emerging  in  the  United  States  and  China,  among  others  (e.g., 
Alphabet,  2024;  Greifenstein  et  al.,  2024;  S.  Wang  et  al.,  2024).  Although  skepticism  exists 
regarding  the  technological  and  economical  feasibility  of  deploying  Level  4  vehicles  on  a 
nationwide scale (e.g., General Motors, 2024; Kaplan et al., 2024), current trends about safety 
concerns  appear  to  point  in  the  positive  direction  (Di  Lillo  et  al.,  2024;  but  see  Cummings  & 
Bauchwitz, 2024). 

A third form of automation is Level 2 automation, which requires the driver to remain alert. Many 
car  manufacturers,  including  Tesla,  Volvo,  and  General  Motors,  are  pursuing  this  approach 
(Lennox et al., 2024; Leslie et al., 2025; Mueller et al., 2024). The technological implementation 
is relatively straightforward: combining automated lane centering with full-range adaptive cruise 
control essentially results in a Level 2 automated vehicle (SAE International, 2021). In this paper, 
we focus on a more advanced form of Level 2 automation, specifically Tesla’s ‘Full Self-Driving’ 
(FSD) product. Tesla initially introduced ‘Autopilot’ for highway driving, relying on lane-keeping 
and adaptive cruise control. Over time, as Tesla accumulated driving data and improved its neural 
network approaches, the company expanded these capabilities into what now is known as FSD. 
Tesla’s  approach  is  interesting  because,  under  Level  2  automation,  the  driver  remains  the 
responsible operator for the driving task. Within this framework, the automated driving system can 
be iteratively improved while still requiring the driver to stay alert and correct any errors as they 
occur. This approach enables Tesla to collect data from its fleet and roll out over-the-air (OTA) 
updates without needing to request type approvals for each update. 

Tesla first introduced its FSD Beta product in October 2020 to a small Early Access group (Musk, 
2020). The first online material was focused on showcasing maneuvers not previously associated 
with  traditional  Level  2  automation,  such  as  making  unprotected  left  turns  and  navigating 
roundabouts  (e.g.,  Tesla  Driver,  2020).  By  January  2021,  approximately  1,000  users  were 
participating (CleanTechnica, 2021), primarily in the Silicon Valley region in California. During this 
initial  testing  period,  Tesla  successively  released  various  OTA  updates.  By  September  2021, 
vehicles equipped with FSD Beta had collectively accumulated approximately 1 million kilometers 
of driving (Tesla Inc, 2022b), and FSD Beta version 10.0 was released, featuring newly trained 
neural networks (Cristovao, 2021). Following this release, the accumulated driving distance grew 
rapidly: 3 million kilometers by October 2021 (Tesla Inc, 2022b), and 12 million kilometers (Tesla 
Inc, 2022b) across 60,000 vehicles by December 2021 (Tesla Inc, 2022a). 

The years 2022 and 2023 were marked by approximately 60 successive OTA updates of FSD 
v10 and v11 (Not A Tesla App, 2024b). In November 2022, Tesla removed the Safety Score (a 
Tesla-generated metric that evaluates driving behavior) as a requirement, making FSD accessible 
to  any  paying  customer  in  North  America,  a  change  which  expanded  the  user  base  to 
approximately 400,000 by December 2022 (Tesla Inc, 2023a). At the time, Tesla’s FSD system 
used  multiple  neural  networks,  each  tailored  to  different  tasks.  Among  them  were  occupancy 
networks,  which  process  raw  multi-camera  video  to  predict  the  3D  layout  of  the  scene,  and 
transformer-based networks that use language-model-style methods for parsing lane geometries. 
Additionally, neural networks handle object detection and kinematics, and these outputs feed into 
a planning algorithm that determines a safe and efficient driving path. Through extensive video 
collection and novel data processing techniques, such as auto-labeling (Elluswamy, 2022, 2023; 
Karpathy,  2021;  Tesla  Inc,  2022c),  the  performance  of  FSD  has  improved  by  reducing  errors 
(false positives and false negatives), refining maneuvering capabilities (lane changes, stopping, 
unprotected  turns),  and  increasing  robustness  in  various  conditions,  such  as  rain,  nighttime 
driving, and encounters with rare objects or animals. By the end of 2023, Tesla’s quarterly report 
indicated an accumulated 1.24 billion kilometers driven.

"It’s still Beta. Paying $12k for it is a bet on the future. Nobody should be buying it for what it is now. From seeing the rate of progress, I’m betting my car will drive better than I within 2-3 years to the point where I’d be find sleeping while it drives. It’s so so so much better than it was a year ago."

The social media posting Trump did this week mocking all the federal employees Musk just fired finally pushed me over the edge. I’m replacing my 2020 M3. What I have discovered in the process is that FSD is apparently worthless. Car dealers will not consider what we paid thousands extra for in determining trade in value. The internet based sites do not consider FSD when determining a value. Neither does Tesla. Has anyone had experience with a private sale? Does FSD have value there?
"Roundabouts/rotaries: If you don’t have FSD Beta, but only the standard Automatic Steering Assist that comes with every Tesla, your car won’t make the sharp turns required in the rotary and will fail midway through. Up until the version of FSD Beta V10.20.2.4, my car would stop dead before entering the rotary but then negotiate the rotary properly. With the latest software updates, my car will treat the rotary properly, like a yield sign, if no cars are approaching you, and will continue to navigate correctly through the rotary. I have experimented with rotaries several times with V11.3.6. The behavior was correct most of the time. However, sometimes my car would just come to a dead stop in the middle of the rotary. Not good."

When I first got my car and enabled FSD it seemed fucking useless.  Like an overpriced toy that didn't work right.  But over time it got better- the images on the screen got sharper as the cameras calibrated better, and it became useful.  

Now I will say that on the highway at least it's a better driver than I am.  So give it time."

"> at the time Elon and everybody was touting how FSD 12 was a game changer and was amazing

It was. Absolutely revolutionary from a software architecture standpoint, and huge improvement in natural driving ability. That doesn't mean it's perfect though. But it was a massive step forward. 

V13 obviously isn't as revolutionary (the core architecture is still an end-to-end neural network like V12), but it is a large step forward beyond V12 and is especially notable for its driving smoothness."

I figure car owners that are young and single might not need FSD, but it’s absolutely a great add-on if you have a family.

"For me, the stress of knowing the car could do anything, at any time, and I had to be ready for it, made using FSD too stressful. This was especially true after it drove me off the road on a straight, deserted stretch of two lane highway. I stopped it from whatever it was trying to do, but WTF. That was it for me."

"FSD is pretty great - but it needs a way for the driver to temporarily influence the car's position in the lane so you can avoid potholes and other hazards that FSD doesn't recognize. A quick push on the wheel, car moves over 2,feet, then returns without switching off FSD."
It depends on the car you have. Older cars with worse hardware packages are significantly worse. Newer cars with HW4 are great with it.
 I'm talking to chocolate.
