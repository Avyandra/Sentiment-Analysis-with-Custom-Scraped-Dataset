128,"my car has been in the shop for like 10 days and counting so far.  see this thread as to why:
2022 myp gps stuck, no cameras, cannot sleep
so thankfully, i got a loaner.  but the great news is, it's got fsd 11.4.4!  this is the first time i have experienced fsd on top of the regular autopilot ""autosteer"".  i already really like autosteer, but this fsd really takes it to another level.  here are my observations:
speed and distance control:  just like the autosteer function, this works really well.  you can set it to drive x% over the speed limit or an actual number (like drive 10 mph over whatever the speed limit is).  i set mine to 10% over the speed limit.  so if limit is 30 mph, it would go 33 mph.  but the good news is, you can still press on the accelerator to override that and take your foot off to return to your preset limit.  so by default, you can set it to drive slowly and you can override it whenever you want to and then it will return to that preset.
works great day or night.  works in the rain also but less effectively (asks you to jiggle the steering wheel more often).
the ""eye in the sky"" - the interior camera looks at a couple of things (see list below i gathered from our forum).   when i played around with it, it actually does work.  i.e. - if i am pretending to be looking at my phone, it asks me to jiggle the steering wheel a lot more often.  ditto if i'm playing around with the touch screen and looking away.

late turn signals:  i wish it would apply the turn signal a little earlier.  or maybe, there should be an option to make it come sooner and later.
it actually stops for stop signs; it doesn't crawl through it.  it doesn't know that if you live in the neighborhood, the stop signs are more like ""recommendations"" (just joking).  and while you can slowly roll through it, of course, you still need to keep an eye out for cars, bikes, kids, neighbors and pets.  from a stop light, the acceleration is jerky and not smooth.  of course, if you put it into ""chill"" mode, it takes care of that.  but the car shouldn't have to treat the go pedal like an on/off switch.  it should gently press on it like a human would.
tentative turning into busy streets - it acts like a nervous teenager when turning into busy streets.  sometimes it jerks the steering wildly when it hesitates when seeing oncoming traffic.
the cameras all around the car can see a lot more of what's going on that you every could...unless you have eyes on the back of your head and above your ears.  if cars are approaching you at a very high rate of speed from behind, it actually senses this and moves you away from the danger.  this actually seems to work outside of fsd.
i love that i can initiate the nav by saying ""navigate to starbucks"" and it actually drives me there!  yes, it asks me to jiggle the steering wheel every so often.  but despite that, it lowers the stress of driving significantly.  i actually love to drive, but i love gadgets even more.  and this stuff is great.
it's certainly not ready for prime time.  but, this is the best ""driver assist"" that i've ever driven (better than mercedes, gm's super cruise, ford's blue cruise, the hyundai variants, volvo and audi/vw).  the reason i say it's not ready for prime time is because tesla advertises it as ""full self driving"".  if they actually called it driver assist, it would still be the best compared to anything else out there.  consumer reports actually ranked gm's the ""best"" since it's truly ""hands free"".  but, it's only good for a limited amount of highways pre-marked by gm.  so that's stupid.  even the mercedes one, which is the first ""true"" level 3 is such a joke since there are soooo many pre-requisites: only works during daylight, there must be a car in front of you, clear road markings, clear weather only (no rain), only for highways marked by mercedes, and get this... only under 40 mph.  that's just ridiculous.  the tesla works everywhere that i've tested: intown and highway.  of course, it works much better on the highway.
so would i pay the $12k for it?  hell no.  that's a ripoff.  if your car gets totaled, tesla no longer will let you ""transfer"" that to your new car.  that's ridiculous.  but would i pay the $200/month for it?  i would do that but only when i would need it for long driving or vacation driving.  otherwise, the standard autopilot is good enough for day to day driving.",car shop like 10 day counting far see thread 2022 myp gps stuck camera sleep thankfully get loaner great news s get fsd 1144 first time experienced fsd top regular autopilot autosteer already really like autosteer fsd really take another level observation speed distance control like autosteer function work really well set drive x speed limit actual number like drive 10 mph whatever speed limit set mine 10 speed limit limit 30 mph would go 33 mph good news still press accelerator override take foot return preset limit default set drive slowly override whenever want return preset work great day night work rain also less effectively asks jiggle steer wheel often eye sky interior camera look couple thing see list gather forum played around actually work ie pretend look phone asks jiggle steer wheel lot often ditto m play around touch screen look away blind dark eyes_closed eyes_down eyes_nominal eyes_up head_down head_trunc looking_left looking_right phone_use sunglasses_eyes_likely_nominal sunglasses_likely_eyes_down late turn signal wish would apply turn signal little earlier maybe option make come sooner later actually stop stop sign nt crawl nt know live neighborhood stop sign like recommendation joking slowly roll course still need keep eye car bike kid neighbor pet stop light acceleration jerky smooth course put chill mode take care car nt treat go pedal like onoff switch gently press like human would tentative turn busy street act like nervous teenager turn busy street sometimes jerk steer wildly hesitates see oncoming traffic camera around car see lot s go every could unless eye back head ear car approach high rate speed behind actually sens move away danger actually seem work outside fsd love initiate nav say navigate starbucks actually drive yes asks jiggle steer wheel every often despite lower stress drive significantly actually love drive love gadget even stuff great s certainly ready prime time best driver assist ve ever driven well mercedes gm s super cruise ford s blue cruise hyundai variant volvo audivw reason say s ready prime time tesla advertises full self drive actually call driver assist would still best compare anything else consumer report actually ranked gm s best since s truly hand free s good limited amount highway premarked gm s stupid even mercedes one first true level 3 joke since soooo many prerequisites work daylight must car front clear road marking clear weather rain highway marked mercedes get 40 mph s ridiculous tesla work everywhere ve test intown highway course work much well highway would pay 12k hell s ripoff car get total tesla longer let transfer new car s ridiculous would pay 200month would would need long drive vacation drive otherwise standard autopilot good enough day day drive,POSITIVE

223,"mph). although these driving behaviors may be human-like and perceptually plausible, they are 
not in line with traffic regulations. 
3. challenging situations and driver behavior. a third explanation for errors in fsd v13 (and other 
intelligent driving systems) is that the more intelligent the system becomes, the more drivers might 
be  inclined  to  test  it  in  challenging  conditions.  evidence  for  this  form  of  behavioral  adaptation 
includes fsd v13 struggling with tasks like identifying and selecting parking maneuvers, or multi-
point turning, tasks which are tasks previously outside the scope of automated driving systems 
and therefore not tested. 
4. perceived error severity and high expectations.  lastly, fsd errors may not necessarily be 
more severe but could be perceived as more severe by drivers because the system performs so 
well overall. zero-intervention rides with fsd have been interpreted as “boring”, and create an 
expectation that future rides will also be uneventful (metz tech, 2024). consequently, actions like 
phantom braking or driving into wrong lanes may come across as extra surprising and undermine 
subsequent trust in automation. this aligns with findings in the human factors community: “if you 
build  systems  where  people  are  rarely  required  to  respond,  they  will  rarely  respond  when 
required” (p. 453. hancock, 2014). 

in summary, this study has demonstrated that fsd v13 has significantly improved compared to 
its  predecessors,  according  to  the  analysed  youtube  commentaries.  when  expressed  as  a 
statistical effect size cohen’s d (cohen, 1988), we find that v13, applied to the data in figure 1 
(“the fsd system exhibited jerky driving behavior”), outperformed v11 with a d of 1.35, which is 
a strong effect. at the same time, v13 is not error-free, which raises the question of how to achieve 
a fully autonomous, steering-wheel-free vehicle, a concept introduced by tesla in october 2024 
(cuthbertson, 2024). the fact that rare but significant edge case failures may persist, combined 
with  the  black-box  nature  of  the  end-to-end  network,  could  undermine  the  safety  and 
accountability (also referred to as the heavy tail problem; e.g., l. chen et al., 2024; koopman, 
2018). 

several  approaches  can  be  thought  of  in  this  regard.  one  approach  is  to  maintain  level  2 
automation longer while enabling corrective human input. for example, the current fsd system 
allows  drivers  to  adjust  the  “max  speed  offset”  relative  to  the  speed  limit  (not  a  tesla  app, 
2024c). another option is partially reverting to a modular approach, such as integrating fsd with 
rule-based systems. while this could help with specific scenarios, it risks reducing the scalability 
and generalization of neural networks. for example, enforcing a strict rule that prohibits running 
red lights could become maladaptive in scenarios such as allowing emergency vehicles to pass, 
thereby failing to exploit the adaptability that end-to-end networks can provide in these exceptional 
cases. 

tesla’s fsd development relies on imitation learning, i.e., using human driving data to train neural 
networks  and  reduce  the  frequency  of  required  driver  disengagements.  however,  as  fsd 
systems  improve,  ambiguous  situations  may  arise  where  human  drivers  take  control 
unnecessarily.  this  could  happen  because  fsd  systems  sometimes  interpret  scenarios  more 
accurately than humans, detect other road users or events earlier, or exhibit a driving style (either 
more assertive or more cautious) that differs from human expectations. the decision to override 
automation  is  inherently  subjective,  echoing  results  from  the  turing  test  (eisma  et  al.,  2024; 
warwick & shah, 2015). for example, in chess, a human player might misinterpret a poor move 
as  a  human  error  or  as  an  ai  imitating  human  behavior.  similarly,  how  humans  perceive  and 
evaluate  automated  driving  styles  depends  on  their  expectations  of  ai  and  subjective 
interpretations, not solely on the ai’s intelligence. these dynamics raise intriguing human factors 
questions, particularly about whether humans fully understand ‘what is happening’ in automated

337,"i have a lot of comments about what you wrote. fsd is wonderful, but yeah, there are some small things

one thing to remember, they are trying to make things as autonomous as possible, so don’t look for new settings that do this or that they don’t want settings. they don’t like settings.

just some small observations 

since they know what a truck is, there should be at minimum toggle to avoid driving behind a truck or avoid merging into a lane next to a truck. they know what a truck is. it shows up on the screen. this shouldn’t be that hard and it should definitely be something that could be controlled on the highway.

as far as passing, i’ve noticed it will not go into another lane to pass on the highway if it cannot pass. it assumes if you’re going to roll a lane that it should be passing the car in front and if it can’t get it speed high enough it doesn’t all of this is a very long way, but there is still a lot of little work to be done and hopefully this will be coming up.

as for navigation, i’ve had it not yet on the right highway exit to get to another highway that it was supposed to in the nav even added that way. but on a few cases, it just didn’t even get over to the lane and needed to. and in one case, i decided to use the blinker to push it into a lane that it could’ve used, but it’s still decided to go the wrong way. it’s interesting because this was never an issue in the past and it’s strange that it doesn’t just follow what the nav says but this is in the upcoming release. note says something that needs to be fixed. i believe so it should be coming in a future update soon, hopefully

hov lanes are still a problem. it doesn’t use them even when you toggle that on. it used to be perfect before and would always just get into an hov lane when you had it on in the past, but now it pretty much ignores it. if you’re in hurry mode, you can move yourself into the hov lane with the blinkers and it will stay there. but if you’re in an hov you ain’t like that and then you decide to change to chill mode. it will try to break the law and signal out to go across the double white line to get out of the hov lane, which is a problem they need to work on hov lanes.  there also should be an extra toggle for pay lanes and i understand hov and pay lanes are only in certain cities, but it shouldn’t be a problem. these things are on the map data too so it’s easy for the car to follow them.

i like your summary and i think we are pretty close. it’s been a while since there’s been any kind of update. in fact there hasn’t been a major update with fsd this year even so i am hoping that the next one will really close the gap on a lot of these things that we’re seeing hopefully, they are hard at work!",lot comment write fsd wonderful yeah small thing one thing remember try make thing autonomous possible look new setting want setting like setting small observation since know truck minimum toggle avoid drive behind truck avoid merge lane next truck know truck show screen hard definitely something could control highway far passing notice go another lane pas highway pas assumes go roll lane passing car front get speed high enough long way still lot little work do hopefully come navigation yet right highway exit get another highway suppose nav even add way case even get lane need one case decide use blinker push lane could use still decide go wrong way interest never issue past strange follow nav say upcoming release note say something need fix believe come future update soon hopefully hov lane still problem use even toggle use perfect would always get hov lane past pretty much ignores hurry mode move hov lane blinker stay hov like decide change chill mode try break law signal go across double white line get hov lane problem need work hov lane also extra toggle pay lane understand hov pay lane certain city problem thing map data easy car follow like summary think pretty close since kind update fact major update fsd year even hop next one really close gap lot thing see hopefully hard work,POSITIVE

389,"larger than its predecessor (tesla software updates, 2024). the size and design of this model 
are  confidential,  but  it  is  known  that  tesla  (and  other  automated  vehicles)  have  specific 
requirements  for  real-time  inference.  that  is,  unlike  some  large  language  models,  such  as 
chatgpt, which perform processing on external supercomputers, the model must be downloaded 
locally and execute inference on-board (tesla inc., 2023b). 

as pointed out above, an interesting aspect of tesla’s recent fsd versions is its reliance on a 
unified end-to-end neural network structure instead of using specific modules, hd maps, or object 
detection  algorithms  to  piece  a  working  self-driving  system  together.  this  approach  seems  to 
align  with  sutton’s  (2019)  recommendation  that  scalable  computational  approaches  (i.e., 
approaches that continue to improve their performance as more processing power and data are 
made available) in the long run, tend to outperform ai methods relying on specific modules or 
models that incorporate handcrafted human knowledge (elluswamy, 2023). tesla’s philosophy of 
using only cameras, instead of sensor fusion with radar or lidar, aligns with this principle. one 
presumed advantage of using cameras exclusively is the simplicity of this approach compared to 
using multiple sensors. when using multiple sensors (e.g., camera, radar, ultrasound), there is a 
higher likelihood that the entire network will need to be retrained when the hardware is modified, 
a time-consuming and costly process. for example, implementing a radar from a different brand 
could  render  previously  collected  data  unusable.  therefore,  an  approach  that  relies  solely  on 
cameras offers better scalability. 

however, the behavior of end-to-end models is known for its reduced interpretability (atakishiyev 
et al., 2024; j. chen et al., 2022; for reviews see l. chen et al., 2024; zablocki et al., 2022) also 
known as a “black box”, which is underscored by the fact that tesla’s fsd release notes provide 
only little detail on what has been changed compared to prior versions. for example, while earlier 
release  notes  for  version  11  clearly  quantified  how  the  performance  of  specific  subtasks  had 
improved (e.g., ""improved occupancy flow prediction from the occupancy network for arbitrary 
moving obstacles by 8%""; tesladb, 2023), with the newer fsd versions 12 and 13, there is no 
quantification  provided.  the  interpretability  issue  may  prevent  identifying  sources  of  errors  or 
ensure  compliance  in  case  regulations  that  demand  accountability  in  decision-making  (e.g., 
tampuu et al., 2022). 

only  little  human  factors  research  exists  on  tesla’s  fsd.  exceptions  include  nordhoff  et  al. 
(2023), who investigated drivers’ use and misuse of fsd. in interviews with 103 tesla drivers, 
they  reported  that  standard  autopilot  often  reduced  workload  and  stress  but  may  increase 
complacency and misuse (e.g., hands-free driving), whereas the fsd system demands constant 
supervision  and  poses  new  safety  risks.  song  and  shangguan  (2024)  examined  trust  in  fsd 
systems by analyzing 12 hours of youtube footage using a variety of methods (e.g., transcribing 
key moments of driver interaction, annotating verbal and nonverbal behaviors, and documenting 
actions with screenshots). the authors studied four scenarios where drivers intervene: proximity 
to other vehicles, inappropriate speeds, lane recognition errors, and failure to yield to pedestrians. 
similarly, brown et al. (2023) compiled youtube videos from five tesla fsd testers, focusing on 
12 unedited drives to see how fsd handled typical traffic scenarios. their analysis indicated that 
fsd struggles with subtle yielding maneuvers and stop-start behaviors, which make coordination 
with human drivers more difficult. passero et al. (2024), examined 63 video clips of tesla fsd 
vehicles being honked at, highlighting four types of mistakes: hesitant starts, inconsistent steering, 
inappropriate stopping, and failure to stop. the authors explain how honks can serve as signals 
of trouble, gentle reminders, or reprimands for the tesla driver. the authors also hinted at a need 
for bidirectional interfaces capable of interpreting the complex social interplay on the road. finally, 
linja  et  al.  (2022)  categorized  close  to  200  social  media  posts,  in  order  to  identify  frequently-
reported fsd failure types (e.g., lane-keeping errors, phantom braking, unexpected maneuvers).

412,"it is evident that the judged number of disengagements has decreased (item 6), while the positivity 
rating (item 1) increased with fsd version number (e.g., 62% for v13 vs. 46% for v10). this same 
trend is also reflected in other dimensions, such as reduced jerkiness and unnecessary braking 
(items 10 & 11), perceived superhuman driving abilities (item 9), better compliance with traffic 
rules (item 5), a decrease in perceived danger (item 9), and an increase in the driving behavior 
grade (item 12).  

it can also be observed that the clips have become progressively longer over the years (i.e., from 
v9 through v13) and that more words were being spoken. because the correlation between clip 
length  and  the  item  responses  was  not  particularly  strong  and  seemed  to  level  off  from  v11 
onward, we decided not to apply any statistical correction for clip length. 

table 2. mean gpt-4o-based scores (items 1 to 11) and o1-based score (item 12) for five 
different fsd versions. 

note. cells are linearly filled based on their value. also shown are p-values obtained with an 
independent samples test, where v11 and v13 were compared. p-values smaller than 0.01 are 
bolded. 

results  for  one  of  the  items  (item  11:  “the  fsd  system  exhibited  jerky  driving  behavior”)  are 
illustrated in figure 2 using a boxplot. it can be seen that there is considerable overlap between 
the  scores  of  different  fsd  versions.  this  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  clips  feature 
different commentators with varying personalities and under different driving conditions. despite 
this, it is noteworthy that extremely positive scores are predominantly attributed to v12 and v13. 
for v10 and v11, only 0.3% and 0.0% of the scores were below 10%, while for v12 and v13, this 
was 9.4% and 27.0%, respectively. in other words, very low scores on the jerky driving item, i.e., 
smooth driving, are primarily reported for the end-to-end networks. 

the correlation matrix (table 3) reveals that negative characteristics such as  disengagements 
(item 6), dangerous driving behaviors (item 8), and jerkiness or unneeded braking (items 10 &

- gets deeply confused about hov lanes and lane choice generally. i'd like to be able ""help"" it choose a lane and then have it stay there. the cancel lane change functionality is poor ui; it should be simple to cancel the intent (and not require ""opposing"" on the turn signal).

- ignores school zone speed limits. i don't know what it's like near where teslas are built, but around here you'll get a ticket for 5 mph over the limit in a school zone. fsd only slows down in school zones when the car in front of it does. otherwise, it's full speed ahead 5 mph over the non-school-zone limit.

- make bad fork choices. maybe it's new roads, maybe they're not marked as well as they should be...but fsd just takes the wrong one.

- brakes hard at a distance from a stopped car, then slowly glides up behind it. it's a little jerky as a rider in the car. it's notably infuriating to drivers behind, who can't understand the point of this stupid and unexpected stopping technique.

on one hand i understand tesla's angle, on the other i think they need to look at this more as getting us invested in their ecosystem. if someone is 8k deep on fsd they're going to be more likely to make tesla their next car again. the day they change the policy on this i will buy it. in the mean time i am content with autopilot which is a system i will and do use regularly to ease fatigue on the highway. 

i will note i'm super impressed with it as well, our first experience with this sort of system was a 23 rogue and while nissan's propilot was 90% there tesla's autopilot is above and beyond better. its much smoother speeding up and slowing down, it doesn't pingpong in the lines like propilot and i'm not afraid for my life passing a truck like with propilot which would hug the right line when doing so. propilot does have auto reengagement after a lane change though you can get that feature with autopilot thanks to the s3xy buttons/knob/commander(a wonderful product).",ve do trial mine active wife s couple week quite fsd ride day night would absolutely plunk 8k fsd stayed never use enough warrant regular subscription nt think worth 8k car ll probably replace 34 year one hand understand tesla s angle think need look get u invest ecosystem someone 8k deep fsd re go likely make tesla next car day change policy buy mean time content autopilot system use regularly ease fatigue highway note m super impressed well first experience sort system 23 rogue nissan s propilot 90 tesla s autopilot beyond well much smoother speed slow nt pingpong line like propilot m afraid life passing truck like propilot would hug right line propilot auto reengagement lane change though get feature autopilot thanks s3xy buttonsknobcommander wonderful product,POSITIVE

it still has hiccups, but in 1600 miles i can tell you every disengagement because they’re rare. 1. there was an obstruction in the road and it pushed it into the oncoming lane and it didn’t get back over for some reason 2. it tried pulling onto a highway shoulder early before an exit 3. it avoided a semi drifting into our lane too aggressively and moved into the shoulder 4. it got stuck at a 5 way intersection that had flashing yellow lights and red lights facing us in both directions (i don’t know how a human is supposed to navigate that properly, tbh).

861,"driving  scenarios.  ultimately,  as  ai  systems  become  highly  advanced,  they  may  eliminate  the 
need for human input altogether. 

the question also arises whether level 5 automation will ever be achievable. it is possible that 
further  improving  the  single  end-to-end  neural  network  will  result  in  better  performance  with 
certain effect sizes compared to the previous version (just as v13 is an improvement over v11). 
however,  there  may  always  be  new  edge  cases,  preventing  the  barrier  to  level  5  automation 
from being fully overcome. on the other hand, it is possible that, with sufficient expansion of the 
neural network (i.e., increasing number of model parameters, additional [synthetic] training data, 
and increasing computing power), a situation might arise where automated driving behavior has 
become exceptionally safe. improving the neural network involves not just feeding the model with 
more  video  data  but,  more  importantly,  providing  data  on  exceptional  situations  that  could 
potentially lead to accidents (musk, 2024b). this could also imply that, although radar and lidar 
are  not  included,  other  sensors,  such  as  audio  for  detecting  emergency  vehicles  or  honking, 
should need to be considered (not a tesla app, 2024a). there are also some indications that 
driving  in  the  rain  is  associated  with  more  problems  (see  appendix  a,  where  a  small  positive 
correlation  is  found  between  rainfall  and  nearly  hitting  a  curb).  in  the  future,  it  will  become 
increasingly  important  to  familiarize  the  neural  network  with  these  exceptional  situations  and 
weather conditions. 

limitations 
the current study is based on youtube transcripts and should not be viewed as a formal test of 
tesla’s  fsd.  it  is  unclear  to  what  extent  the  youtube  content  creators  were  biased.  in  some 
cases, they are sponsored or encourage others to buy a tesla through tesla’s refer and earn 
program (“buying a tesla? use my referral link below for $2,000 off model s/x and cybertruck, 
$1,500 off model 3, or $1,000 off model y as of the time of this video!”) (e.g., east coast tesla, 
2024; tesla inc, 2025d). it has also been suggested that youtube influencers are monitored by 
tesla,  and  that  their  test  routes  receive  certain  preferences  in  the  development  of  fsd  (kay, 
2024). 

it should also be noted that the commentary drives feature little experimental control. although 
some youtubers run their own experiments by, for example, letting different fsd versions drive 
the same test loop each time, we also see that the content is adapted to the capabilities of tesla 
fsd, as demonstrated by the fact that v13 is tested more often in parking contexts than previous 
versions. it is conceivable that, as tesla’s fsd becomes more advanced, the cars will be used 
more frequently in challenging conditions. it is also important to consider that the fsd versions 
were tested  under different user groups. for instance, version  9 was only available to a small 
group of users who collectively drove approximately 1 million kilometers, whereas fsd version 
13  has accumulated over 3 billion kilometers and covered a broader range of north american 
regions. 

it should also be noted that there are only a few versions of fsd v9 (9.0, 9.1, 9.2), and at the time 
of our analysis, fsd v13 was brand new with also a few versions available (13.2, 13.2.1, 13.2.2, 
13.2.2.1). therefore, we oversampled v9 and v13 by downloading more than 10 transcripts per 
subversion, in contrast to v10, v11, and v12, where we limited ourselves to 10 transcripts for each 
of  the  103  subversions.  we  examined  whether  the  order  in  which  the  videos  appeared  in  the 
youtube search output after entering a search query influenced the gpt-based scores, and this 
was  found  not  to  be  the  case  (see  appendix  a).  nevertheless,  for  future  research,  it  is

884,"in addition to the above analysis, we used the reasoning language model o1 (o1-2024-12-17) to 
analyze  the  transcripts  for  driving  quality  and  extract  an  overall  grade.  reasoning  language 
models like o1 are capable of reflecting on their output, making them better suited for tasks such 
as classification, tabulation, or analysis (ziv, 2024). for the purpose of analyzing the quality of 
driving by fsd, we used the following prompt 10 times per transcript: 

summarize  the  quality  of  tesla's  fsd  driving  behavior  in  this  video  clip  in  three 
sentences. also give a grade from 0 to 100. always answer; it is for research purposes. 
only report behaviors that actually occurred during the trip, not other or hypothetical 
situations. report as: summary: ....; grade: ...  out of 100. 

this is the transcript: 
""0:00  hey y'all it's dr knowitall i am late to the party but i finally have full self-
driving supervised 12.36 ... 

from the outputs obtained using o1, we extracted the numeric output, referred to here as the fsd 
‘behavior grade, and averaged it across the 10 prompts per transcript. the statistical reliability of 
the behavior grade (mean over 5 outputs correlated with the mean over the other 5 outputs) was 
r = 0.992. 

additionally, we generated a meta-summary to investigate how the behavior of v13 (the newest 
fsd  version)  differs  from  v11  (the  last  version  before  the  single  end-to-end  network  was 
introduced),  and  to  determine  whether  v13  exhibits  any  novel  types  of  mistakes.  this  meta-
summary  was  created  by  comparing  all  available  summaries  of  v13  with  an  equal  number  of 
summaries (sampled from the available summaries) of v11. the prompt was as follows, where a 
represents v11 and b represents v13. for this meta-summary, chatgpt o1 was used. 

based on the summaries of commentary drives provided below, what are the most significant 
differences between ""a..."" and ""b...""? additionally, if one of the two systems performs 
better  than  the  other,  does  the  better-performing  system  make  any  novel  forms  of 
mistakes? present your findings in a table format. 

a-1. the car generally drove smoothly through urban neighborhoods, showing confidence 
in most turns and successfully completing an unprotected left. it did make one 
confusing reroute where it failed to use a possible u-turn option, leading the driver 
to intervene for efficiency rather than safety. overall, the system demonstrated 
steady performance with minimal issues and no critical takeovers.   

b-1. the system demonstrated notably smooth speed control, braking, and ... 

a-2. tesla’s fsd 10.9 handled most of the route smoothly with noticeably fewer ... 

b-2. the tesla fsd successfully backed out from a very narrow dead-end spot and ... 

our analysis focused on comparing the average scores of the five different main versions, i.e., 
v9,  v10,  v11,  v12,  and  v13.  we  also  examined  correlations  between  these  numeric  scores. 
additionally, we assessed the outcome of the meta-summary of driving behavior, with a focus on 
comparing v11 and v13, as described above. 

results 
table  2 provides the mean gpt-4o-based scores and o1-based scores calculated for the five 
different fsd versions. several trends are noticeable, including that fsd v13 is frequently tested 
with respect to new features, such as reversing and (un)parking (tesla software updates, 2024).

960,"there was no fsd 7 years ago. in october of 2016 the cars had hardware 1 and the autopilot convenience feature. that system was based on self-driving hardware from mobileye with some tesla software added. it only worked on highways but at the time weaved back and forth in its lane. it had basic summon, autosteer, autopark, traffic aware cruise control, speed assist (it could read speed limit signs) and driver-initiated lane change. it didn't turn at intersections, stop at stop signs and didn't recognize traffic lights. it didn't recognize many types of objects in the road.

i drove that system until i got my model 3 with hardware 2.5 in 2016, later upgraded by tesla to hardware 3.0. the software then was divided between enhanced autopilot (eap) and fsd. they later released navigate on autopilot that added highway features, specifically automatic lane change, passing slower traffic, automatic exits and merges and exits to follow a route. later they added stop light control (stops for lights).  i joined the fsd beta limited test group in december of 2021 and now i drive a model y with hw4 and fsd 11.4.4 (the latest beta is not available on hw4).

over the last 5 years i have seen addition of features (like advanced summon that can drive in parking lots with no driver to a location indicated with the app) added and the basic features improved. early eap had a hard time staying on a road with sharp curves and the driving was very jerky. it handled stop signs and made turns at intersections. advanced visualizations show on the screen the locations of other cars, trash cans, traffic cones, traffic signs, pedestrians, dogs and painted street turn lines.

i did a 5000 mile road trip in 2019 with eap. it made the difference between a driving ordeal and a relaxing trip.

with early fsd, the car couldn't make turns at intersections onto high-speed roads. it confused flashing yellow caution signs with yellow traffic lights. i could make a very long list of repeated problems with the system that gradually over time got worked out. but yesterday, my car drove me 28 miles from my home into town on a mix of rural streets, sharply curved highways, interstate highway and city streets and then back again without disengagement.

fsd stills makes mistakes as the op noted, but it is far easier to anticipate and correct its mistakes than it is to drive the car yourself. and i fully believe that fsd plus me is safer than either of us alone. 

for someone with physical limitations, it can make the difference between being able to drive and not. so is it worth $12,000? i paid only $8k in 2018 so i may not be the best person to ask, but i think it is -- for me.

as for the future, i don't think *anyone* outside of tesla really knows when or if any currently equipped fsd car becomes a level 4 autonomous vehicle. the 300,000 lines of code that drive the car today are being scrapped, totally scrapped, in favor of ai and machine learning. it's a totally new ballgame.",fsd 7 year ago october 2016 car hardware 1 autopilot convenience feature system base selfdriving hardware mobileye tesla software add work highway time weave back forth lane basic summon autosteer autopark traffic aware cruise control speed assist could read speed limit sign driverinitiated lane change nt turn intersection stop stop sign nt recognize traffic light nt recognize many type object road drove system get model 3 hardware 25 2016 later upgraded tesla hardware 30 software divide enhance autopilot eap fsd later release navigate autopilot add highway feature specifically automatic lane change passing slow traffic automatic exit merges exit follow route later add stop light control stop light join fsd beta limited test group december 2021 drive model hw4 fsd 1144 late beta available hw4 last 5 year see addition feature like advanced summon drive parking lot driver location indicate app add basic feature improve early eap hard time stay road sharp curve drive jerky handle stop sign make turn intersection advanced visualization show screen location car trash can traffic cone traffic sign pedestrian dog paint street turn line 5000 mile road trip 2019 eap make difference drive ordeal relax trip early fsd car could nt make turn intersection onto highspeed road confuse flash yellow caution sign yellow traffic light could make long list repeat problem system gradually time get work yesterday car drove 28 mile home town mix rural street sharply curve highway interstate highway city street back without disengagement fsd still make mistake op note far easy anticipate correct mistake drive car fully believe fsd plus safer either u alone someone physical limitation make difference able drive worth 12000 paid 8k 2018 may best person ask think future nt think anyone outside tesla really know currently equip fsd car becomes level 4 autonomous vehicle 300000 line code drive car today scrap totally scrap favor ai machine learn s totally new ballgame,NEGATIVE

as  prior  experience  showed  this  duration  was  sufficient  for  reliable  output.  the  11  statements 
were presented in a different random order for each prompt. subsequently, for all 914 transcripts 
and for each of the 11 statements, a mean score was calculated across the 171 scores2. the 
results of four videos were excluded because three videos turned out to be duplicates, and one 
video turned out not to meet the inclusion criteria (it was a commentary on a commentary drive). 
as a result, our findings are based on a total of 910 transcripts. 

the  statistical  reliability  of  the  11  items  was  assessed  by  calculating  the  mean  of  the  910

of course not.  i bought it as a lottery ticket.  currently i believe it's not worth much at all, because it really isn't usable and each of the last 5 or so updates have made it worse, not better.
once it works, and i still believe it will, then it will be well worth more than $200 per month, but there is no guarantee that it will still be available at $200 per month.
so presently i would not give $1 per month for it, because at the end of the month, i haven't gotten $1 worth of value for it and it expired at the end of the month and has no future value.
if there were a guarantee that if you subscribe for $200 per month now, the price is locked in and it will be available permanently at that price, then i would buy it.  but if you don't subscribe now, then there is no guarantee the you can in the future?  buying it for $15,000 is a hedge in case the subscription price could be $5,000 or ??? per month in the future.

for example, when we had the free month a few weeks ago, i was on a drive between houston and austin in my 21 model y. nice four-lane road, everything well-marked, the car showing that it completely understood the road based on the display. i was in the left lane a lot, and multiple times at 75mph, the car would out of the blue try to take one of those short cut outs on the left for taking a side road or turning around to go the other way. because the car was navigating straight, it made no sense that it would even try to take a left turn at over 70mph. if i hadn’t already been a little on edge and holding the steering wheel to override it, i would have been in the median at high speed. it wouldn’t have been trying to turn left or around, it was just trying to steer me into the middle ditch.

around town and in the neighborhood, it gets waaaaay too close to street-parked cars and curbs on the right as well.

i can respect all the work they’ve done with this, and the dedication to getting it right, but if it acts this weird in easy situations, we’re a very long way from robo-taxis. i think it’s shocking they’re still able to charge so much for something that really doesn’t deliver on its promise.",work part unchallenging situation never feel especially safe subscribed couple time monthlong trial trial do something unnerved every time always felt like need hyper aware drive 100 drive even use autopilot highway part example free month week ago drive houston austin 21 model y nice fourlane road everything wellmarked car show completely understood road base display left lane lot multiple time 75mph car would blue try take one short cut out left take side road turn around go way car navigate straight make sense would even try take left turn 70mph already little edge hold steer wheel override would median high speed try turn left around try steer middle ditch around town neighborhood get waaaaay close streetparked car curb right well respect work do dedication get right act weird easy situation long way robotaxis think shock still able charge much something really deliver promise,POSITIVE

for me the biggest flaw it has, which i encounter everyday, is that it dies not see the arm gates at the entrance/exit  of my community. during the day it almost never sees it  while at night it sees it most of the time as it is shining bright. it is clearly a limitation of the camera only system, as i guess it needs more contrast to detect a 3-4 inch narrow obstruction which is not against a fully contrasting background (even though it is still completely visible to any human even with limited visibility).

my point being when we encounter these unusual conditions we need to flag them and submit them for the tesla (or whomever) team to add them to their ""outliers"" list in order to augment their training.  

what would also benefit humanity is if the construction industry developed a localized warning radio signal. so i'm approaching a construction area and need to take control - okay - what if a local signal triggered a panel message ""approaching construction (or accident) area - roadway compromised - please assume control of vehicle.""",contact tesla really fsd machine learn system although tesla make leap bound always thing never encounter mean ived nice world road well marked signage clearly readable traffic light operational d well never reality note selfdriving system struggle construction area surprising lane mark may need ignore signage detour flagmen etc may invoked tesla fatality apple engineer try debug software chronic construction area terrible layout cruise fatality pedestrian flung another vehicle path also saw issue emergency vehicle block generally clear roadway point encounter unusual condition need flag submit tesla whomever team add outlier list order augment training would also benefit humanity construction industry developed localize warn radio signal m approach construction area need take control okay local signal trigger panel message approach construction accident area roadway compromise please assume control vehicle,NEGATIVE

positives:

- autopark seems \~20% faster

- maneuvering around in traffic seems much better/smoother. stopping/decision making seemed more confident/human like. this is the first real noticeable improvement i've seen since the v12 rollout a few months ago.

negatives:

- my first drive to the local shopping center was going really well. at the stoplight intersection i heard a few sudden loud noises coming from the brake pedal while i was stopped, like the car was going to move. it didn't move, but it was alarming and happened a few times. 

- autopark worked great/faster. when i came out and got in the car to drive home a bunch of errors popped up:

1662,"lous said:
i have just finished my free, 1-month test of tesla’s full self-driving capability in april/may 2024. i bought my first tesla model s in 2017 and traded up to a long-range model s late in 2023 when they kept throwing incentives my way. i love driving the model s both because of the potential environmental impacts, but also because it is a wonderful performance car. i drive on interstates, other 4-lane roads and on city streets, so i do different types of driving and i think that the model s excels in all modes.
my original model s had adaptive cruise control, and at the time, i thought that this was the best safety feature ever for driving on interstates, especially in and around cities. it also had autosteer, although it did not always work that well. nonetheless, good safety features and i thought that the current version of both adaptive cruise control and autosteer worked well. the only problem i had with autosteer was on a 4-lane road that had a crown in the middle, so that the mechanism would shut off in the uneven left lane.
i very explicitly used fsd exclusively at times, on all types of roads, with no manual intervention. overall, driving in fsd with the navigation system set to a specific address was a wonder to behold. the car turns by itself, even onto interstate on/off ramps, accelerates carefully into traffic and adjusts speeds when needed. as it transitions from interstate to city roads, it follows the new speed limits exactly. the parking feature is cool, when needed, and from a lab, proof-of-concept idea, fsd would seem to be a great feature. but,…
overall, i developed a strong dislike of the system. it most reminded me of being driven by a teen-aged driver, who had just received their learner’s permit and had a parent in the front seat. i used the system for virtually all driving, from crowded city streets to wide-open 4-lane country roads and felt that it wasn’t driving like real people. getting into traffic from a parking lot or when making routine turns, the car would sit there until no cars or pedestrians were in sight. sometimes the wait would be excessive, by virtually anyone’s standards, and it was very frustrating. it would accelerate smoothly to the speed limit—it would be a poster child for traffic police, but unnatural in the real world.
worst of all, it didn’t always work. in driving into a major population area in the midwest on an interstate, it shut off 3 separate times on a specific road. this road had been improved by replacing degraded surfaces with sections that were separated to allow for expansion and contraction. very useful for weather in late winter/early spring and the road has remained intact for some years. but fsd didn’t like the bumps between sections and shut down. keep your hands on the wheel when the car is no longer on auto at 70 mph!
i found driving in fsd mode in the city to be unnatural. it was too perfect and also too methodical—as if performed by a computer! if you live in places like chicago or boston, you will not be a “favorite” of other drivers. i concluded that i wouldn’t want to share the road with vehicles with no driver that used the fsd capability, like a robotaxi. if we do allow such vehicles, we will have to build separate lanes or even separate roads to accommodate the different types of driving. hopefully, some of these faults will improve as ai improves, but it is certainly not ready for prime time at the moment.
anyone else give the fsd a try? i’d like to read other opinions.
click to expand...
having grown into it from its earliest iterations i appreciate it much more but i understand those that have had it for only a month will have a different take and experience.   it takes getting used tp and since v12, i rarely drive without it.  my very best experience with it was when i used it as my designated driver late one night.
i would suggest anyone give it more than a month.  it takes more than that to reach a confidence level that keeps you from unnecessary disengagements.
i'm looking forward to 12.5 and other future improvements.  however, if 12.3.6 was as far as it went, i would be satisfied.  i wish to stay engaged when driving and am worried that the complacency of fsd might make me forgetful when driving our other tesla without it.  certainly for those of us advanced in years, it may be necessary one day.  i remember how not being able to drive affected my dad.
as to other drivers, it's time they weren't able to think and act like cowboys on the road and have more patience or take more time for the privilege of getting around.  there is precious cargo on the road and it's time we all grew up to our collective responsibility on the road.  it's not an amusement park.  fsd will help balance out the extremes, of too cautious and slow and too careless and fast.   boring perhaps but safer.
if eventually it's like taking a bus or train, well then, we may enjoy the drive more, especially long trips.  maybe i've said too much.   happy trails.",lous say finish free 1month test tesla full selfdriving capability aprilmay 2024 bought first tesla model 2017 trade longrange model late 2023 kept throw incentive way love drive model potential environmental impact also wonderful performance car drive interstate 4lane road city street different type drive think model excels mode original model adaptive cruise control time thought best safety feature ever drive interstate especially around city also autosteer although always work well nonetheless good safety feature thought current version adaptive cruise control autosteer work well problem autosteer 4lane road crown middle mechanism would shut uneven left lane explicitly use fsd exclusively time type road manual intervention overall drive fsd navigation system set specific address wonder behold car turn even onto interstate onoff ramp accelerates carefully traffic adjusts speed need transition interstate city road follow new speed limit exactly parking feature cool need lab proofofconcept idea fsd would seem great feature overall developed strong dislike system remind driven teenaged driver receive learner permit parent front seat use system virtually drive crowd city street wideopen 4lane country road felt drive like real people get traffic parking lot make routine turn car would sit car pedestrian sight sometimes wait would excessive virtually anyone standard frustrate would accelerate smoothly speed limitit would poster child traffic police unnatural real world bad always work drive major population area midwest interstate shut 3 separate time specific road road improve replace degrade surface section separate allow expansion contraction useful weather late winterearly spring road remain intact year fsd like bump section shut keep hand wheel car longer auto 70 mph found drive fsd mode city unnatural perfect also methodicalas perform computer live place like chicago boston favorite driver conclude want share road vehicle driver use fsd capability like robotaxi allow vehicle build separate lane even separate road accommodate different type drive hopefully fault improve ai improves certainly ready prime time moment anyone else give fsd try like read opinion click expand grown early iteration appreciate much understand month different take experience take get use tp since v12 rarely drive without best experience use designate driver late one night would suggest anyone give month take reach confidence level keep unnecessary disengagement m look forward 125 future improvement however 1236 far go would satisfied wish stay engage drive worried complacency fsd might make forgetful drive tesla without certainly u advanced year may necessary one day remember able drive affected dad driver s time nt able think act like cowboy road patience take time privilege get around precious cargo road s time grow collective responsibility road s amusement park fsd help balance extreme cautious slow careless fast boring perhaps safer eventually s like take bus train well may enjoy drive especially long trip maybe ve say much happy trail,POSITIVE

1867,"fsd v12 was a game changer, just as much as v13 is compared to v12.

v12 you can automate roughly 90% of your driving, with some small annoyances like how it handles stops and turns but you get used to it. v12 was also too conservative and you often had to step on the gas to give it confidence.

v13 just brings it to 98-100% of your driving time, is more confident and most of my driving i don’t have to touch the brake, steering wheel or gas even once. 

considering since v12 is good enough to automate 90% of driving, i don’t think its worth it upgrading especially since elon has stated they will be upgrading hw3 cars at some point for free if you purchased fsd. just keep in mind though the cameras on hw3 will never be upgradable, it’s only the computer hardware that would be replaced to allow hw3 run v13 at some point. also ai can optimize itself and eventually run on hw3 on its own too.

1926,"fsd is honestly terrible outside of interstates from my experience.

i have multiple places on my 25mi commute where it makes terrible / dangerous decisions.  and it makes those exact same dangerous moves daily and never learns. 

for example my town has flashing yellow lights at crosswalks.  so the tesla thinks it is a yellow traffic light and slams on the brakes as it approaches each one.  i know now to hover my foot over the accelerator at each one but that kind of defeats the purpose of fsd.

when it turns left at a light on my commute it goes into the turn lane out of the turn lane then back into it before making the left turn.  and it does this every time.  so i have to disengage it before that light daily. 

at a railroad crossing it thinks it is a red stop light.  so it wants to slam on the brakes and stop.  it doesn't do this every time but probably 50% of time.  

when entering the interstate it never uses the turn signal and instantly moves into the middle lane every day.  

when exiting the interstate it wants to stop even though you only need to stop if turning left off the ramp.  going right doesn't need to stop but the car doesn't know that since it just reads the stop sign.",fsd honestly terrible outside interstate experience multiple place 25mi commute make terrible dangerous decision make exact dangerous move daily never learns example town flash yellow light crosswalk tesla think yellow traffic light slam brake approach one know hover foot accelerator one kind defeat purpose fsd turn left light commute go turn lane turn lane back make left turn every time disengage light daily railroad cross think red stop light want slam brake stop nt every time probably 50 time enter interstate never us turn signal instantly move middle lane every day exit interstate want stop even though need stop turn left ramp go right nt need stop car nt know since read stop sign,NEGATIVE

2007,"robotaxi  services  are  currently  emerging  in  the  united  states  and  china,  among  others  (e.g., 
alphabet,  2024;  greifenstein  et  al.,  2024;  s.  wang  et  al.,  2024).  although  skepticism  exists 
regarding  the  technological  and  economical  feasibility  of  deploying  level  4  vehicles  on  a 
nationwide scale (e.g., general motors, 2024; kaplan et al., 2024), current trends about safety 
concerns  appear  to  point  in  the  positive  direction  (di  lillo  et  al.,  2024;  but  see  cummings  & 
bauchwitz, 2024). 

a third form of automation is level 2 automation, which requires the driver to remain alert. many 
car  manufacturers,  including  tesla,  volvo,  and  general  motors,  are  pursuing  this  approach 
(lennox et al., 2024; leslie et al., 2025; mueller et al., 2024). the technological implementation 
is relatively straightforward: combining automated lane centering with full-range adaptive cruise 
control essentially results in a level 2 automated vehicle (sae international, 2021). in this paper, 
we focus on a more advanced form of level 2 automation, specifically tesla’s ‘full self-driving’ 
(fsd) product. tesla initially introduced ‘autopilot’ for highway driving, relying on lane-keeping 
and adaptive cruise control. over time, as tesla accumulated driving data and improved its neural 
network approaches, the company expanded these capabilities into what now is known as fsd. 
tesla’s  approach  is  interesting  because,  under  level  2  automation,  the  driver  remains  the 
responsible operator for the driving task. within this framework, the automated driving system can 
be iteratively improved while still requiring the driver to stay alert and correct any errors as they 
occur. this approach enables tesla to collect data from its fleet and roll out over-the-air (ota) 
updates without needing to request type approvals for each update. 

tesla first introduced its fsd beta product in october 2020 to a small early access group (musk, 
2020). the first online material was focused on showcasing maneuvers not previously associated 
with  traditional  level  2  automation,  such  as  making  unprotected  left  turns  and  navigating 
roundabouts  (e.g.,  tesla  driver,  2020).  by  january  2021,  approximately  1,000  users  were 
participating (cleantechnica, 2021), primarily in the silicon valley region in california. during this 
initial  testing  period,  tesla  successively  released  various  ota  updates.  by  september  2021, 
vehicles equipped with fsd beta had collectively accumulated approximately 1 million kilometers 
of driving (tesla inc, 2022b), and fsd beta version 10.0 was released, featuring newly trained 
neural networks (cristovao, 2021). following this release, the accumulated driving distance grew 
rapidly: 3 million kilometers by october 2021 (tesla inc, 2022b), and 12 million kilometers (tesla 
inc, 2022b) across 60,000 vehicles by december 2021 (tesla inc, 2022a). 

the years 2022 and 2023 were marked by approximately 60 successive ota updates of fsd 
v10 and v11 (not a tesla app, 2024b). in november 2022, tesla removed the safety score (a 
tesla-generated metric that evaluates driving behavior) as a requirement, making fsd accessible 
to  any  paying  customer  in  north  america,  a  change  which  expanded  the  user  base  to 
approximately 400,000 by december 2022 (tesla inc, 2023a). at the time, tesla’s fsd system 
used  multiple  neural  networks,  each  tailored  to  different  tasks.  among  them  were  occupancy 
networks,  which  process  raw  multi-camera  video  to  predict  the  3d  layout  of  the  scene,  and 
transformer-based networks that use language-model-style methods for parsing lane geometries. 
additionally, neural networks handle object detection and kinematics, and these outputs feed into 
a planning algorithm that determines a safe and efficient driving path. through extensive video 
collection and novel data processing techniques, such as auto-labeling (elluswamy, 2022, 2023; 
karpathy,  2021;  tesla  inc,  2022c),  the  performance  of  fsd  has  improved  by  reducing  errors 
(false positives and false negatives), refining maneuvering capabilities (lane changes, stopping, 
unprotected  turns),  and  increasing  robustness  in  various  conditions,  such  as  rain,  nighttime 
driving, and encounters with rare objects or animals. by the end of 2023, tesla’s quarterly report 
indicated an accumulated 1.24 billion kilometers driven.
