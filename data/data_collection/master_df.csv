"Based on my experience I would agree with most of the things you have mentioned, except for #1. For me it does seem to work exactly the way one would want it to, it immediately starts changing lanes unless it determines it to be unsafe. Also I haven't encountered any potholes yet, but I think it did avoid some debris on the road a couple of times (it hasn't hit any debris yet).

For me the biggest flaw it has, which I encounter everyday, is that it dies not see the arm gates at the entrance/exit  of my community. During the day it almost never sees it  while at night it sees it most of the time as it is shining bright. It is clearly a limitation of the camera only system, as I guess it needs more contrast to detect a 3-4 inch narrow obstruction which is not against a fully contrasting background (even though it is still completely visible to any human even with limited visibility).

This makes we wonder what else it won't see and try to drive right through."
"I have a lot of comments about what you wrote. FSD is wonderful, but yeah, there are some small things

One thing to remember, they are trying to make things as autonomous as possible, so don‚Äôt look for new settings that do this or that they don‚Äôt want settings. They don‚Äôt like settings.

Just some small observations 

Since they know what a truck is, there should be at minimum toggle to avoid driving behind a truck or avoid merging into a lane next to a truck. They know what a truck is. It shows up on the screen. This shouldn‚Äôt be that hard and it should definitely be something that could be controlled on the highway.

As far as passing, I‚Äôve noticed it will not go into another lane to pass on the highway if it cannot pass. It assumes if you‚Äôre going to roll a lane that it should be passing the car in front and if it can‚Äôt get it speed high enough it doesn‚Äôt All of this is a very long way, but there is still a lot of little work to be done and hopefully this will be coming up.

As for navigation, I‚Äôve had it not yet on the right highway exit to get to another highway that it was supposed to in the NAV even added that way. But on a few cases, it just didn‚Äôt even get over to the lane and needed to. And in one case, I decided to use the blinker to push it into a lane that it could‚Äôve used, but it‚Äôs still decided to go the wrong way. It‚Äôs interesting because this was never an issue in the past and it‚Äôs strange that it doesn‚Äôt just follow what the NAV says but this is in the upcoming release. Note says something that needs to be fixed. I believe so it should be coming in a future update soon, hopefully

HOV lanes are still a problem. It doesn‚Äôt use them even when you toggle that on. It used to be perfect before and would always just get into an HOV lane when you had it on in the past, but now it pretty much ignores it. If you‚Äôre in hurry mode, you can move yourself into the HOV lane with the blinkers and it will stay there. But if you‚Äôre in an HOV you ain‚Äôt like that and then you decide to change to chill mode. It will try to break the law And signal out to go across the double white line to get out of the HOV lane, which is a problem they need to work on HOV lanes.  There also should be an extra toggle for pay lanes and I understand HOV and pay lanes are only in certain cities, but it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. These things are on the map data too so it‚Äôs easy for the car to follow them.

I like your summary and I think we are pretty close. It‚Äôs been a while since there‚Äôs been any kind of update. In fact there hasn‚Äôt been a major update with FSD this year even so I am hoping that the next one will really close the gap on a lot of these things that we‚Äôre seeing Hopefully, they are hard at work!"
Great write up. Especially on the ‚Äúmust change lane when turn on blinker‚Äù point. I‚Äôve run into this problem so many times.
"My signal-to-lane change percentage is more like 90%, but it‚Äôs not 100%.

It really needs to be 100%."
The follow distance at high speeds is massive for me. There is ZERO excuse to be going 75 with only 2 car lengths gap. Its has no clue about worst case scenarios
"Yup. All of the same experiences. I am in a HW3 and have used FSD through 12.2 to 12.5 and all of these have persisted.  

BTW somewhere after 12.2 lane keeping got MUCH MUCH worse. Sometimes so bad it drifts out of the lane and turns off FSD.  

As well with 12.5 it seems to drive like a bad driver now. Kind of scooting close to people as they pass that car instead of staying center in the lane or moving away from the danger. Very odd.   

Overall I use FSD much less since 12.5 it has become way less predictable and fails tasks it used to be perfect or very good at in previous version."
"Great feedback.  The potholes thing really bugs me.  Also, something you wouldn't know if you didn't use older versions is that the on-screen display used to show things like garbage cans and traffic cones, but for some reason they got rid of that.  Now you *sometimes* see a blob of color where there are major obstacles, but the older controller was better in that regard."
"Potholes and road signs are show stoppers in my opinion. In my area, you can destroy a wheel or worse in a pothole. I also have an issue where FSD will enter a road on the wrong side, consistently, ignoring the large Do Not Enter and one way signs. And FSD not following the navigation route is annoying. I think we‚Äôll know when FSD is ready once Tesla addresses any crashes or damage caused while driving with FSD as warranty issues or covered by their insurance. Need to have faith in your products."
"1(a)- totally agree
1(b)- it does sometimes, but in this case why did you let it hit the tire?
2) Agreed. Misses digital speed limits frequently. Doesn‚Äôt read ‚ÄúNo turn on red between 6am - 6pm‚Äù, or STOP (except right turn) caveats.
3) Agreed- misses lane marking (ground arrows) too
4) Yep. Follow distance is too close- should always be 2 seconds behind vehicle in front. (3-4 seconds in poor weather)

Good review. I think most of these things are fixable, hopefully."
"4 is so bad. Lifted, speeding f150s and it will happily ride behind them in the fast lane."
8_ it can‚Äôt read ‚Äúno turn on red‚Äù sign
"I do have to laugh a bit, why are you letting your car hit road debris? FSD has a long way to go, having to disengage it isn‚Äôt really the end of the world, don‚Äôt hit stuff instead of disengaging‚Ä¶

For me FSD is a lot more stress free if I don‚Äôt try to let the car figure a situation out for itself. I disengage, fix the issue, and reengage."
"Jesus, I didn‚Äôt know super chargers not having WiFi is a FSD issue."
"I've never had an issue with lane changes.  Are you sure you were doing a full pull on the stalk?  If you only do a half pull, it will generally not actually change lanes."
Austin has a lot of training data because it‚Äôs tons of poor people that don‚Äôt have regulations and open roads. It still underperforms in my experience
I find the super cruise to be much better on interstate driving however not available on most secondary highways. Using Lidar and cameras is far superior to just cameras.
Agree with most items.  When I ask for a lane change via blinker it's usually about 80% compliance.  Sometimes there is no cars around and I don't know what it could be deeming a safety hazard.  HW 4 version 13 FSD.  Generally very good.  Some issues are it does not always follow carpool laws.  It will go in and out of double solid white lines into carpool lanes or out of instead of waiting for entrance/exits.
"Other manufacturers have caught up, or even surpassed. Very aggressive levels of protectionism will prevent those options from coming and competing in the US. 

https://youtu.be/VuDSz06BT2g?si=JFnOlyVZbGB8W5Va

Also: Eventually Google will probably license out their tech to certain manufacturers, but that‚Äôs probably a long way away."
The fact that it moves out of the way for faster cars was the thing that surprised me the most
You can always pay the $99 when you have road trips coming up...and enjoy driving the rest of the time...it's not exactly a punishment to have to drive a Model 3 - they are the most fun to drive of the Tesla lineup...
"How far in advance can FSD be ""turned on"" if we don't already have it?  Can it be turned on instantly, and we instantly get charged $99 -- or does it have to be ordered ahead of time? (I hope that makes sense üòÄ)"
"I'm still hoping that one day I get into my car after a software update and I'm offered a three-month trial of FSD, like I had for EAP when I got my car new. I'm in Australia so Tesla's goal of the first half of this year is definitely... ambitious."
"I got my first EV (Tesla Model 3 LR RWD) back in December as well. Based in DFW metro. I will be driving down to the Gulf coast in a few weeks, first roadtrip with it and I have free FSD until May (and free Supercharging until March) so I'm excited to see how it goes!"
"I drove 6 hours to Seattle last weekend on FSD in my 2018 Model 3. It was an intensely bright day and the shadows kept freaking it out. Random breaking events on I5, not good. Also, has the AI training really not covered flashing yellow caution lights? It idiotically and repeatedly would see them as a full stop light turning yellow and lock ‚Äòem up. After 5 random braking episodes, I couldn‚Äôt take it any longer and shut it off."
"I appreciate the free trials, but I ultimately bought the car so I could drive it myself.  When I need it, the free Autopilot is more than enough."
"I subscribed to FSD after free trial. Price seems reasonable and it is fun to use. 
Best of all you do not have to keep touching and tweaking the steering wheel like auto pilot."
"Be thankful you have the latest hardware. Just got v12.6.1 on my HW3 Model Y and it‚Äôs a regression from the prior version. Speed control is absolutely broken. Constantly bleeding speed in almost every situation, including the interstate."
"FSD is pretty great - but it needs a way for the driver to temporarily influence the car's position in the lane so you can avoid potholes and other hazards that FSD doesn't recognize. A quick push on the wheel, car moves over 2,feet, then returns without switching off FSD."
"Had 2 free trials and it was terrible here in Saskatchewan, Canada."
"If we don‚Äôt pay for fsd, will the Tesla still react in a moment of urgency that  accident may happen. Btw I love the fsd though I‚Äôm still scared and get used to it haha"
"My free trial expires May 9th. It is an utter clutch feature for areas you‚Äôre not familiar with and are using a GPS, or in bumper to bumper traffic. 

Otherwise I‚Äôd rather drive cause I love my 25‚Äô m3. 

Today it failed me though, was supposed to make a right based on GPS data and it made a random left lol scary but there was no one to my left. üòÇüôèüèª"
"Does it match the speed of the traffic? The last time I tried FSD, it wasn't moving with the speed of traffic and was really slow."
"I use mine daily, and although I still encounter some issues, it works exceptionally well!"
"Hi  I'm being honest here when I say that for a longish normal drive (I have a 100 mile 2 hour between home and family), FSD is brilliant.

FSD is very smooth and honestly doesnt get distracted or drive bored like I do at times.  if a car makes a sudden slowdown or crappy abrupt lane change FSD slows, wits or changes lanes accordingly and continues back up to speed.  

It doesnt get frustrated (like me) it doesn't get mad at the other driver ( like me) and as a result of its competence I get where I'm going in a much more relaxed state.

Ive only had one issue where FSD decides it is going to use the left hand HOV lane despite the double line and significant markings/signage.  didnt even wait for the merge point just signaled and accelerated in... I had to calm her down with an abrupt grab of the wheel :-)"
If you have fsd updated‚Ä¶. When u pay for a sub do you have access instantly?
"It's come a really long way. I kept it off for a long time because it was so miserably bad, but nowadays I feel like I could keep it on if I wanted to. 

I still prefer to drive myself until it gets a bit better for anything but freeway stretches, but that's where most of the tedium of driving is for me anyways so it's all gravy to me."
"'24 M3 v13 since Christmas. Was super on a trip ATL-BNA, using while on vacation in an unfamiliar city.  Planning a trip to Detroit and will specifically find a HW4 with FSD to rent.  Hertz got snookered prematurely but now would be the time for a fleet of FSD rentals.  I'm cheap but when the $99 renewal rolls around, I keep it on. So handy for drinking coffee on the days I have to drive into work, relaxing commute.  Also used it going in-town for a live performance.  I don't drink but still... it just helped the enjoyment of the evening not having to mess with putting my brain into driving mode esp at night. It'd help if relaxed having had a few cocktails. For sure, it's still makes some boneheaded mistakes on occasion but the kids still call it Jeeves.  It's very close to recommend to a friend whose dad is 82 and still driving where this may help extend independence, be able to get around in cases when  reluctant to drive AND make him less of a liability to others as far as safety.  Jeeves drives much better than my 85yr old stepmother.  My sister is in a wheelchair and this feature would be great for her in a different format car - she needs to disassemble the chair, lower the setback to chuck it in the back seat. Doubt there are hand controls available."
I do not use FSD here in Michigan because the speed limits are wrong over half the time. Are there really places this is not normal?
"After driving a 2022 Model 3 as a loaner from Tesla, I will say that the Highland model 2024/2025 is so much better at FSD. The 2022 accelerates too fast and doesn‚Äôt seem that safe to fully drive in FSD. The 2025 Highland maneuvers smoothly and has human like behavior."
You could‚Äôve led with the fact that you wouldn‚Äôt pay $100 a month for it. Cheap really just means you don‚Äôt see the value in the feature for the amount that it cost.
"FSD is a tireless family chauffeur that everyone can afford to hire. Its passing is always flawless. I am especially astounded by its night driving capabilities. 

I figure car owners that are young and single might not need FSD, but it‚Äôs absolutely a great add-on if you have a family.

Update: on FSDv13.2.2.1"
"I have V3 and it‚Äôs already incredible, but I think it‚Äôs nearing the end of its lifespan. Can‚Äôt wait to see what V4 will be capable of this year or what v5 will be able to do."
"Would argue anytime there is construction happening, it is predictably bad and would not trust it. 

I have found sometimes it struggles to know when to run the yellow light, it will instead slam on the brakes and disengage.
It also has issues with lighted crosswalks."
"That lane drift when there‚Äôs a double left turn lane is infuriating. What would it take to make it prefer one or the other? I‚Äôd be less mad about it getting into the less preferable one vs the indecisive tendency it has. The driver behind you is just left annoyed. 

I agree with all of your points."
"Regarding rigid route selection...

When you cycle through the different map orientations (North Up, Heading Up, Route Overview), it will let you select alternate routes in the Route Overview view. It will give you an option to select fastest route, or shortest route. And if a route with local roads is only a few minutes slower than the fastest route (like a highway route) it will give you that option too.

It's pretty good, at least in my city it is."
"What I don‚Äôt understand is how there is no User Defined Adjustments beyond surface level.

There should be a way for the user to Change specific basic parameters, or stimulus based on geolocation. If it Always makes a wrong turn, the user should be able to correct it, and the correction propagate and persist as the dominant choice for that repeated destination.

Whether it is a specific speed, acceleration/deceleration, avoiding a repetitive phantom brake, there should be persistent user feedback to influence problem points. 

Also changing the core pull away and braking profiles should be as easy as sliding a time based function on screen to represent the desired profile.

There are so many little details that would be easy to ‚Äúmask‚Äù the problems or even fix the problems by allowing the user to effect repetitive details."

"Hugs the edge of the road on turns.  Nearly struck the curb before I took over.

Trial was fun.  I'll never pay for it."
"I‚Äôve been using it basically every day since the trial started with FSD 12. I don‚Äôt understand how you can possibly be so positive about it. 

It can‚Äôt handle a simple roundabout near my house (goes between lanes, doesn‚Äôt know where to exit), it has horrific speed control - brakes way too heavily at crosswalks with no one at them and is worse at speeding up and slowing down gradually than someone‚Äôs first day using one pedal driving. FSD is going to cause people to get rear ended with its random slow downs and braking"
Do you prefer chill or standard on FSD?
"Fair review.  

About the only thing I don‚Äôt like about FSD is the strict eye monitoring.  Can‚Äôt spend more than about 2 seconds on your phone or the touch screen before it beeps at you.  

Oh yeah.  And the price.  $99/month still too much for what it actually does & amount of supervision it requires.  I‚Äôd pay about $29."
Blue moons are VERY common for my 12.3.6 2023 MYP. The way people say it reduces stress and fatigue is weird to me. Using FSD with its constant stupid decision making adds significant stress.
"Is this really most people's experience, or just a shill account of FSD? I used it a handful of times during the free trial, mostly in an urban environment on highways in and around DC, and it was unusably bad. I can't understand how people's experiences are so varied."
"Have u noticed there are a few things fsd constantly can't detect? Chain fence been one of them, railroad crossing as well."
So are you going to continue to subscribe to fsd?
Awesome breakdown thank you!
"Anything on the highway is still using the old FSD v11 stack, which I think Tesla made a mistake not putting everything on the FSD v12 version when they deployed the free trial.  It seems most people's issues are highway based and yeah that still has issues."
"1 week, almost swerved off the road for a tumbling bag ü´†"
The first day I got mine I was driving home after picking it up on the other side of the state I live in and I was on a highway.  I signaled to switch lanes into the right lane right around where there was an off ramp.  FSD tried to choose the off ramp as the correct route instead of staying on the highway so I had to pull the wheel to stop it from heading off the freeway.  The lesson learned was to always be vigilant and aware that the car's decisions may not always be the same decision you would make.
"I dont understand how you are not having more issues than you did. Maybe its the navigation data in my area or something, but its..not good."
I am constantly battling the instinct to take over and the thrill of seeing what it will do. Choose wisely.
"Unfortunately within half a mile from my house it consistently has trouble with a certain single lane that goes quickly into two lanes. Every time. It has trouble picking one side or the other and kind of sits in the middle. Otherwise, if you have some patience the FSD does quite well about 98% of the time. Patience meaning you don't mind if you are more than a car length behind the car in front of you and maybe the car behind you is on your tail, for example."
"Do you contact Tesla with any of this?  Really FSD is a ""machine learning system"" and although Tesla has made leaps and bounds there will ALWAYS be things it has never encountered before.  I mean if we ived in a nice world where all roads were well marked, all signage was clearly readable and all traffic lights operational we'd be better off.  But that will never be the reality.  I note that all the self-driving systems are struggling with construction areas. Not surprising. This is where lane marking may need to be ignored and where signage (detours, flagmen, etc) may be invoked.  The Tesla fatality (Apple Engineer trying to debug the software)  was in a chronic construction area with a terrible layout.  The Cruise fatality was when a pedestrian was flung by another vehicle into its path.  We also saw issues with emergency vehicles blocking the generally clear roadways. 

My point being when we encounter these unusual conditions we need to flag them and submit them for the Tesla (or whomever) team to add them to their ""outliers"" list in order to augment their training.  

What would also benefit humanity is if the construction industry developed a localized warning radio signal. SO I'm approaching a construction area and need to take control - okay - what if a local signal triggered a panel message ""Approaching construction (or accident) area - roadway compromised - please assume control of vehicle."""
"I'm still on the free month of FSD in my new Y, but I've already turned it off. Too many inexplicable lane changes, missing streets and trying to turn where there's nothing, etc etc. It still feels very half baked. I'll come back in a few years and check it out again."
"Even autopilot had me speeding through a construction zone on I-20 at 80 mph. Just didn't see the 45mph speed limit sign. Fortunately, the police had already pulled someone over"
I sit in traffic on the highway at least 3-4 times a week and FSD has been life changing. I come home much more relaxed and at ease. I wouldn‚Äôt use it on the regular side roads but on the highway it‚Äôs worth $100 per month
I hate the phantom braking
Please pay attention
"Another bad: I would add that when merging back out of the passing lane, it will merge way too close to the person you just passed. It will then sometimes slow down around those times and just cut that person off. Drives me nuts"
"Overall impressive, but not close to trustworthy yet.

- Gets deeply confused about HOV lanes and lane choice generally. I'd like to be able ""help"" it choose a lane and then have it stay there. The cancel lane change functionality is poor UI; it should be simple to cancel the intent (and not require ""opposing"" on the turn signal).

- Ignores school zone speed limits. I don't know what it's like near where Teslas are built, but around here you'll get a ticket for 5 mph over the limit in a school zone. FSD only slows down in school zones when the car in front of it does. Otherwise, it's full speed ahead 5 MPH over the non-school-zone limit.

- Make bad fork choices. Maybe it's new roads, maybe they're not marked as well as they should be...but FSD just takes the wrong one.

- Brakes hard at a distance from a stopped car, then slowly glides up behind it. It's a little jerky as a rider in the car. It's notably infuriating to drivers behind, who can't understand the point of this stupid and unexpected stopping technique.

- Terrible at right turns from stop signs. Stop at line. Creep forward, stop at line again. Get honked at by furious pickup truck driver who already spent this month's salary on shiny rims and is angry that his wife is angry because the kids needed shoes."
Does anyone know why waymo is so much better?
"I prefer auto steer beta. FSD required too much baby sitting. Auto steer is not without fault. I was driving on a curvy mountain rd( well marked lines) and I came upon a sharp right hand turn just when a large gravel truck, with axles every couple feet, came around the corner staying in his lane. My Y freaked out and braked hard and started to steer toward the cliff wall . I turned it off and scolded my car with a tongue lashing for unreasonable fear of oncoming traffic. It still needs work and I will use it with caution."
"FSD got me to and from Santa Monica, CA on a Friday during rush hour both ways.  Anyone who lives in SoCal or has visited long enough knows how terrible that traffic can be."
"Robotaxi???!!!  Lolololol!!!!  Out of all the nonsense lies Musk spits out, this is the one you choose to entertain?  Come on people, catch on already. Lies to pump up the stock is what that is."
"You know some stop signs that have flashing red lights hanging overhead across the street? FSD loses its shit there - goes into ""should I shouldn't I"" inching forward and braking on repeat üòñ"
"Definitely far, very far from being ready. It is very unpredictable, but I would argue even while paying attention. It's like you're driving and all of a sudden your co-pilot takes the wheel and tells you, ""Change lanes here, no never mind, here."" So even while paying attention, that can be something you can overreact to and try to overcorrect, causing an accident. Also, one time while driving on the highway, it suddenly ""disconnected"" and applied regen braking. I would not trust it at all, not at this stage."
"All very accurate assessment check out this site we found after buying the Y.¬†

https://www.tesladeaths.com/"
"Me reading comments after getting FSD outright on my model Y lol‚Ä¶ I drove it a couple times (demo) in pure mind crushing traffic and it exceeded expectations took limited risk and performed well enough for us to go in and buy it then and there‚Ä¶ 

But I understand what people are saying it‚Äôs still learning and developing and should be used with precaution esp on open roads cause it doesn‚Äôt have many cars to base its movement on. Hopefully with V13 Tesla adds more customization and ability to teach your car on your routes"
"So, I‚Äôm new to Tesla. 

But the OP‚Äôs #1 on the bad list is something that seems to be my situation for why I came looking. 

I drive a major interstate daily, and the vehicle in FSD really struggles to maintain the lane when the wheel needs to be turned to the left.  It will completely drift all the way off the interstate if you allowed it. The odd part, when in auto-steer mode, it navigates the same stretch of road with no issues.  

Anyone have any thoughts?"
I set 3 destinations to get through morning traffic avoiding highways - annoying

"I wonder if it's a matter of expectations versus reality. When I got in around Christmas last year I thought it was the bee's knees. I still use it on every drive, but there are certain intersections where I know it just hasn't figured it out and I tap on the brakes to get out of it. on the other hand, there are curvy roads I drive daily where it works flawlessly, and I am shocked at how good it is with oncoming traffic on relatively narrow residential streets with no dotted yellow central lane painting. 

it's super sketchy turning into parking lots, but when I'm feeling excited for some bumpiness I let it drive into lots. 

agree with you and the rest of the comments that it's not worth 12k"
I would compare it to a teenage driver.
I use FSD Beta for my 110 mile commute every day and it's perfect for like 108 of those miles.
The best argument I've heard for fsd is that the TACC feels more natural for braking/accelerating.
"It hasn't driven me into traffic or done anything weird in awhile.

FSD 11.4 can get me between locations I frequent with almost 100% reliability, which is a huge step forward from 6 months ago.

Is it $12k worth?  Nah, and I don't advise people pay that.

I bought a used Tesla and FSD in the used market is valued about $1500.  That's definitely worth it to me and it's pretty neat when I'm doing a long drive or just want a mental break for a little bit while driving.

I've used it for moderately long drives and it does a pretty good job.  

It's not Level 3 driving.  It's close for most uses."
"I have a 2022 MYP, ran Autopilot today on the highway for the umteenth time. 70mph without a car 1,000ft in front or behind me. Car slammed on the brakes randomly bringing my to 50 in an instant. Phantom braking is an absurd bug of these cars, I wouldn‚Äôt trust FSD if it was free. Somewhat of a personal opinion but both my Teslas, and 3-friends all have experienced the phantom braking which is pretty ridiculous for a glorified cruise control."
"I honestly think FSD beta is a game-changing technology. It might have its flaws sometimes such as when it tried to drive on the wrong way or changed lanes waaay too late to get into an exit, but overall I was extremely impressed by what it can do. It made almost 95% of my drives with no interventions smooth. I still don't think it's worth $12k or $200 per month but I think it shows how far automotive technology has come. Maybe my expectations were low and I was just amazed at what a car can do so I ignored most of the small flaws many long-time FSD beta testers point out. Overall it's very cool and mostly useful but definitely not worth the cost."
"FSD for sure isn‚Äôt perfect and has a room for improvement. However I just got my hands on free FSD beta and I was blown away. Zero intervention drive and gives me a good faith that FSD would one day be the best autonomy solution out there.

Edit: added away! üòÇ"
"I feel my $8k was well spent.

Drives me to and from work 95% on its own every day.

Really takes a specific type of person IMO to ‚Äúenjoy‚Äù using the beta.

Nothing against anybody"
FSD is a totally ripoff
Never was good. Everyone just lies saying it‚Äôs good to justify the amount they spent. And if you say this they get mad and down vote lol
"Tried to kill my once going through a light, tried a second time going through a light‚Ä¶didn‚Äôt try for a third time. Total waste of money!"
FSD will shred your tires and ruin your rims; it doesn‚Äôt avoid potholes.
"Fsd best friend is accelerator pedal. To solve 90 percent of the timidness just use press on the pedals. 

This alone has improved my fsd so much that I use it every trip. Try it out."
FSD isn‚Äôt worth it to me either. But the free basic autopilot is the bomb. Love that feature
Oh damn I think it‚Äôs amazing - is it perfect? Far from it but 80% of my driving is FSD. Can‚Äôt wait for V12
"The system used in the crash is an old version of Autopilot, not FSD. FSD works pretty well on the highway but can be quite hit or miss everywhere else, worth noting that the current FSD v11 is going to be completely replaced/rewritten with v12 which looked promising but who knows."
"Has anyone, other than Elon, said it‚Äôs worth 12k? No one is getting that value out of it."
[removed]
Few here will like hearing this but I‚Äôm one of those people who could have bought a Plaid if I wanted to. I wanted to buy a Model X or Y but when it came time my friends‚Äô reviews of FSD were so bad I bought a gasoline truck. I care about the environment and really wanted an EV but if I‚Äôm going to spend $100k over 5yrs for a car I want it to be a luxury. I picked overland with my wife and kids which has been a lot of fun and way cheaper than a Tesla but deep inside I wish I had autonomous commuting. Who knows in 5yrs maybe I‚Äôll have an option.
"I got a 3 month fsd trial. It‚Äôs been a month now and it is now off. Not smooth, too many false positives. The value on the highway is limited, and in the city it is scary. So even at $0, it is off"
"I am kinda baffled you think it‚Äôs bad. I have used fsd beta for hundreds of miles at this point.

Pros on highway i used üíØof the time .

Off highways depends, if no construction I let it drive or if there are a lot of loghts

I don‚Äôt use it on streets with stop signs. No rolling stops really kills it for me. And I like to drive sometimes.

Is it worth 12k , hell no. I would pay 6k for it.

Disclaimer I got it for ‚Äúfree‚Äù on a used Tesla that didn‚Äôt list it as a feature."
"Not paying 12 k myself ever for this but I feel like ya just can‚Äôt expect it to do everything for you. I‚Äôve been in a friends car that has it and there were some left turns he‚Äôd let it try for morbid curiosity but IMO that‚Äôs the time to turn that shit off and just take the turn yourself. You can usually foresee when it‚Äôs gonna have a hard time and you don‚Äôt gotta let it do it. And taking over from time to time momentarily is what ya gotta expect to do. 

If the dream is straight robot taxi this ain‚Äôt it. But can‚Äôt it actually obey stop lights and drive on most roads without too much issue‚Ä¶.. usually, haha. I mean for most of the drives I been on it can be ok and much better than any other car driver assist I‚Äôve seen

Even my normal autopilot I shift off if things are looking a little challenging (weird painted lane lines or other cars driving weird around me). I‚Äôm paying attention anyway so it feels fine to do it and honestly prefer it. Hell, I‚Äôd take over sometimes when another person is driving if I could sometimes to prevent some BS. Why do I want to be a backseat driver when bullshit is approaching on the road when I‚Äôm in the damn driver seat?

Fuck 12k though"
"Your car is new yes? If so it's part of the HW4 era which hasn't been focused on in terms of developing the autopilot. They're finishing up FSD for HW3 this year and next year they'll be working on HW4 as far as I've heard. The FSD beta for HW4 is currently rather low functioning but it works well for highways and country roads, and actually deals with traffic pretty well. My complaints are how it deals with intersections, merge lanes, automatic lane changes, speed control and unclear road markings."
Help it through the slow points and enjoy the relaxation. lol idiot
"It‚Äôs not perfect yet, but I use it for the most part it does well everyone‚Äôs looking for perfection like why isn‚Äôt this miracle any better? at least they‚Äôre trying to do something. The system still needs you to pay attention."
"Just drove 680mi from NC to MA in my 2019 M3PLR and only took control of the vehicle when exiting the highways to charge.  Best chauffeur in NYC ever. Absolutely do not recommend in MA, Massholes are absolute lunatics and want to kill you."
"I still use FSD Beta daily without major issues and think it has improved greatly in the last two years we have had it.

Your experience makes me curious. Have you tried re-calibrating your cameras since your first try of FSD Beta? Also just wanting to make sure, you are using the FSD Beta and not Production FSD (what software version do you have on your vehicle)?

Hopefully the promise of FSD can be realized sooner rather than later, but regardless of some people‚Äôs opinions I have read saying they think self-driving vehicles are never coming or are far in the future, I think everyone will be surprised in the next 5-10 years on what will be achieved."
"It's always amazing on the different experiences, or rather expectations, people have with FSD. My commute is 100 mi round trip and I paid 10k nearly 2 years ago for it. My commute is both highway and city streets and for the most part I intervene infrequently other than hitting the accelerator. I have it on nearly 100% of the time, even if driving just a couple of miles. Yes, on occasion it does try to kill me, so you have to be attentive, but overall I'm still quite impressed at what it does even 2 years later, and it has gotten better with time. This summer I rented a Tesla and driving it without FSD was a pain in the ass in comparison. I am in no way disappointed that I paid 10k, and would do so again."
I had the exact opposite reaction. I was shocked at how good it was..even in roundabouts.
"I‚Äôm on the FSD Beta and use it literally, no exaggeration, 99% of the time I‚Äôm on the road. I LOVE it. I see now I‚Äôm probably one of the few people who still loves it but o genuinely couldn‚Äôt be happier with my purchase. I make a 4 hour drive about twice a month and FSD has made the drive so much safer, more relaxing, and comfortable. 

I am not trying to say it‚Äôs universally amazing or anything. I‚Äôm sure in more dense city driving it feels more uncomfortable and robotic. I drive up and down New England all the time and FSD is a pure joy (at least here)."
"Totally agreed. Today I decided to give FSD another shot before the trial expires because more and more people on reddit swears by it. Oh well. On the highway, when I'm only about 1 mile till the next exit, it decided to switch to the faster lane because I'm on the right lane traveling at 62 mph and the set the max is 64 mph. The traffic was heavy so I quickly disabled FSD and reenabled after the car is back to its lane.

In another place, I was on a surface street (not highway), the car all of sudden turned on the right blinker and decided to turn right then quickly turned it off. 

I don't care what others say about it - the basic autopilot is a lot more reliable and won't make ""dumb decisions"" like these.

Oh, about the auto lane change part that will be gone by the time the trial is over. I frankly don't care because half of the time the auto lane change is too slow when the traffic is heavy, and when the traffic is light, I really don't need it."
"It‚Äôs really good on the highway. Path planning off highway isn‚Äôt there yet, we shall see how v12 turns out and progresses."
"My latest FSD subscription expired on Sunday and man, autopilot is so much better. 

FSD drives like an asshole. It has gotten worse since I used it earlier this year. 

I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll get it again unless I hear about some major improvements."
"FSD is honestly terrible outside of interstates from my experience.

I have multiple places on my 25mi commute where it makes terrible / dangerous decisions.  And it makes those exact same dangerous moves daily and never learns. 

For example my town has flashing yellow lights at crosswalks.  So the Tesla thinks it is a yellow traffic light and slams on the brakes as it approaches each one.  I know now to hover my foot over the accelerator at each one but that kind of defeats the purpose of FSD.

When it turns left at a light on my commute it goes into the turn lane out of the turn lane then back into it before making the left turn.  And it does this every time.  So I have to disengage it before that light daily. 

At a Railroad crossing it thinks it is a red stop light.  So it wants to slam on the brakes and stop.  It doesn't do this every time but probably 50% of time.  

When entering the interstate it never uses the turn signal and instantly moves into the middle lane every day.  

When exiting the interstate it wants to stop even though you only need to stop if turning left off the ramp.  Going right doesn't need to stop but the car doesn't know that since it just reads the stop sign."
"FSD Beta drives me all the way to work through Seattle (about 5 miles) without intervention. I do step on the throttle at times to push through its indecisiveness though. It works well in light rain but not in heavy Seattle rain.
Always pay very close attention to it. It‚Äôs there to help, you are still responsible for running into stuff."
[removed]
"This thing is beta, and they want $12000 or $200 a month? I tried it for 3 days, and it is definitely not ready."
"I tried it today. Very concerning on complicated double left or right turns, nervous on construction roads, nervous on highway turnarounds. I just can‚Äôt trust it yet."
[removed]
It's not worth anywhere near the price tag.
"If I had to describe FSD in one word, it would be ‚Äúinconsistent‚Äù. A couple weekends ago it managed to drive me from [nearly] home to a destination three cities over. That includes highways, city roads, country roads ‚Äì it did it all with a surprising level of competency. But also, it can‚Äôt drive down my street without slamming on the brakes or driving down the middle of the road into oncoming traffic."
I wonder how many people buy it after the free trial. I can‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs very many.
I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me. Thought I got a lemon MY. Seems like most of my drive is outside of the FSD‚Äôs capabilities.
"Fsd is great tool for delivery driver. You put in the addresses and it will take you there and you can somehow relax because you won't miss a turn. $12k depreciate for 5 years $2125 per year to increase efficiency reducing loss time due miss turn is worth every penny. It isn't for everyone but once you know how to operate it, other cars out there feels ""old"" no matter how cool features they have.

And yes it recognized deer when I didn't see it crossing the street due to glare from incoming car. Worth every penny."
I love how all this negative sentiment always piles up right around earnings‚Ä¶
It can't even complete my simple 7 mile daily commute to work which is on a divided highway and two left turns without issue.
"I don't think camera only based self driving will ever work properly, as the cameras are too limited compared to radar or lidar. And Elon Musk have claimed since I believe 2014 that next year they will have  FSD ready. That is just FUD. 

Having said that Tesla said that with the new version 12 they will only use AI to create the FSD instead of rules, so it will properly get worse first before it gets better if ever with current hardware. 

https://www.teslarati.com/tesla-full-self-driving-12-rules-based/"
Has ayone else noticed that Autosteer is starting to exhibit some of the same stupid as FSD?
You can tell if a Tesla has FSD or not by how it gets off the highway. üòÇüôàü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Works fine for me...95% of the time.
I‚Äôve owned FSD since 2019 when all the grand hype promises were made.   I‚Äôm remain shocked at how bad it is.
Ok
"I'm not sure what happened with your drive, but FSD has millions of miles on it and I will assume your experience was not representative of the overall performance. So sweeping judgments are probably not helpful."
"Like many technologies, you have to learn how to use it"
I think it‚Äôs you
"You should try AP, that one sucks even more."
"Actually Tesla's FSD was ahead of the competitions. They had all the real life data with the best AI engineers in the whole world.

Then Elon got distracted by Twitter (or X)..."
Video proof?
"atleast $2,500"
"I'm a long time user.  It's has it's good releases and not so good releases.  My current version does some really flaky stuff at intersections.

None of it really matters or is an indicator because the software will be massively different when 12 comes out.  Much more AI.  It will be interesting to see what that means, better or worse."
"I almost ran over a giant plastic trash can yesterday and my car seems to have trouble knowing when the right lane just ends and turns into a shoulder/no road, but it doesn‚Äôt slow down or change lanes."
"
> How are you guys getting $12K of value out of this?

I paid $3K. Worth it."
"Thats why here in Canada , some insurance companies including CAA refuse to insure Tesla with FSD enabled."
"worth 12k, no way. not yet, but I'm on 11.4.7.2 and use it 50% of the time I drive.

it does take some learning to do it skillfully because it is not fully autonomous yet.

drove 5000km across Canada this summer and it was a great tool to have especially at the end of the day driving into a new town and having it find the hotel.

being from the tech industry my expectations were low, so I was impressed. sounds like your expectations may have been based on the name or the hype.

but you make a huge leap to your 10 year prediction. interesting to know what that might be based on? it's rate of improvement over the past year at least looks promising."
Which software and you have FSDb turned on? Not just AP?
It‚Äôs easier to defend it once you‚Äôve dropped $12k on a running experiment
"My M3 seems to have learned my area better the more I use it. That said, I really only use it on the highway now. Too many close calls."
Tesla should be sued for saying they have anyteven close to real autopilot !
"There‚Äôs a lawsuit happening because people were sold a feature with the promise that it would one day be ready. That day will never come because the technology on the car can‚Äôt deliver it. 

It doesn‚Äôt even work for Elon. His team just gets the city to adjust the streets where FSD screws up. He constantly freaks out about it almost killing him, but goes on stage talking about how it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsolved‚Äù problem. 

Snake oil anyone?"
"It's funny because during today's earnings call Musk said, and I quote, ""FSD is best thing ever. It drives him everywhere with 0 disengagements. """
I haven‚Äôt had one issue with FSD and use it often.
Hopefully we see the rate of improvement accelerate
same. when its good its good but when its bad its insane. it requires significantly more attention than normal auto and even more than no auto at all.
there def are some intersections or non standard looking turns that confuses the FSD. other than that on well lined streets and normal intersections it's pretty good. the not avoiding potholes /unevement pavement kind of sucks though.
"Bad compared to what? 

Which competitor where you comparing it to and by what metrics?"
"FSD is good on highways and larger city streets, especially when following another car. It‚Äôs like a newly permitted driver, you are supervising driving. Definitely not worth $12k. 

I subscribe for a month here and there when I want to try FSD out again or show someone. It‚Äôs cool to me, but scary to my family so I can‚Äôt use it with them in the car.  I commute 180 highway miles 3 times a week and prefer Autosteer over FSD for that. It‚Äôs more predictable and doesn‚Äôt need to record me on camera to operate."
"I use it almost daily. Having auto-steer on city streets with stop sign and stop light recognition is amazing. You can always give it some extra go pedal if it‚Äôs lagging too far behind or taking too long at a stop sign. I also use the turn signal to change lanes manually when I know it‚Äôs prudent.

It‚Äôs not perfect and left turns can be awkward. It really is more of an exercise in being a passenger, which is difficult when the driver is a computer. I probably overly second guess and intervene because I‚Äôm not confident in it in certain situations. Reminds me of all the times I second guessed gps directions to find out it was right all along lol."
"Funny.  The first time I used it with my gf, she was blown away, and continues to be blown away, about just how well it drives, safer than 99% (made up stat) it drivers, in almost all circumstances.  I am an early beta user (first batch) and where it is now, I use for most of my drives and well over 50% there is no intervention.   I guess everyone‚Äôs mileage will vary."
"I went on a long road trip on a highway and figured I would try it out the subscription. It worked great on the highway and on and off ramps. But just terrible on city streets. I wish I could just turn that feature off, and just use the highway part of FSD (i know I can just turn on autosteer, but it still behaves differently than FSD beta off highway driving). 

I probably won‚Äôt be renewing the subscription at the end of the month."
"I got a used Tesla and it came with FSD. it can be weird at times, but I made a trip from Austin to Dallas with it driving me like 95% of the time. I use to make a 30 minute drive to and from town. Idk it definitely can be ungodly jank and inner city driving I wouldn‚Äôt but I love the feature. 12k is crazy , but I would pay a 2-3 thousand for the feature for sure after haven driven with it for about 3-4 months now."
"I subscribed to FSD for a few months just to know what it's like and yeah, it's terrifying at times.  The random lane changes that you can't completely turn off infuriate me.  At least in EAP / Nav on AP you can tell it to not proceed automatically with a lane change, but in FSDb if it wants to change lanes, screw you it's gonna.  And it will make you look like an idiot driver doing it as well since you will jerk the wheel back into your preferred lane, and then fiddle with the turn signal making it flip back and forth while everyone behind you wonders if you know what a turn signal is for.  If you could just tell it to maintain your current lane until it's actually time to turn or exit or whatever, it wouldn't be so bad.  I'm the kind of driver that would rather drive in the lane I'm in vs weave around people that are ... not impeding me."
"I go everywhere with the fsd. It's awesome. Frankly if I can, I'd let it go pick up my meals. Lol"
It‚Äôs great on the highways - nothing else
"We‚Äôre on vacation renting a bmw ix and the driving assist is a lot better than the eap on the 2022 MY. Especially in stop and go traffic.

FSD has barely any benefit in europe, so can‚Äôt say anything about that."
I don't trust standard Autopilot ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
It's horrible to be honest.  I am amazed when it drives well for a full drive which happens rarely.  Today it was in the right most lane for a left turn which the map showed I am supposed to turn left but FSD doesn't seem to listen to the map lol!!
Strangely I use almost every day and I can almost go anywhere in my area with hardly any interventions.  I guess our expectations are different.
"I share your experience.  I just turned on FSD on my new Model Y a week ago for a 7 mile in-city drive, and I had to take over 8 times to keep from annoying other drivers too much.  My 4 year old son was annoyed when I finally gave up, but I needed a break.

I've found it does much better when following a vehicle vs having to make all the decisions on its own.... so, good ol Autopilot."
"Robotaxis coast to coast travel in 2018 guys, just around the corner"
"General consensus: too expensive, too many safety concerns anyway, a few vocal/ardent advocates muddying what is otherwise a very clear conclusion: no to FSD in its current state."
Ten years is a looooong time.
"FWIW I think it needs time to calibrate.  

When I first got my car and enabled FSD it seemed fucking useless.  Like an overpriced toy that didn't work right.  But over time it got better- the images on the screen got sharper as the cameras calibrated better, and it became useful.  

Now I will say that on the highway at least it's a better driver than I am.  So give it time."
"We went with basic autopilot and only use it on the freeway (obviously) and that's the only place I'll trust it after seeing it in my parents X which drives like a distracted 15 year old.

I already get that feeling while teaching our 19 year old how to drive. I don't need that when I'm th only person in the car......"
its really bad at times.  like super bad.
"Anyone claiming to get value out of FSD, no matter how much they paid, is simply lying to themselves to make themselves feel better. Buying it outright for $10k when I bought my M3 is one of the dumbest things I‚Äôve done with money in my life."
I love the opinions of new users‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs like reading reviews from Karen‚Äôs for restaurants that don‚Äôt deserve the criticism.
I have it on my 2022 MYLR and it's fine on the highway but locally? Not so much. And summon and auto park SUCKS!  I feel like I was scammed a bit and tell anyone listening NOT to give Musk money for FSD. It's not worth it. If he loses that cash flow he might actually work on it.
"I'm on 2023.27.6 on our Model Y and I noticed that sometimes FSD will randomly start the wipers in totally dry conditions with a clean windshield... Once the car was so stuck on putting the wipers on I had to forget about engaging FSD. When going out of FSD, wipers would stop and they were still set at Auto. So annoying and incomprehensible."
"I find it very jerky when it enters a highway on ramp, but very smooth otherwise"
"I never use it to make turns or drive through traffic jams.  I really don't want any automated driving for that. 

It is great on long trips on the highway or on long stretches of road.  I've probably driven 10,000 miles with it on."
Proof?
"I tried it in San Diego last year and it was pretty good. Drove a whole day without any issues. But every other car is a Tesla in the area I was driving so data set may be better. 

Here is the big issue: Tesla is cutting out millions of lines of code from FSD and replacing it with AI. So FSD takes one step backwards for two steps forward. One day it works fine and then they update the code base and it is shit for a while. You are a guinea pig. 

So it is really for enthusiasts only at this point. This is one that Elon hit the crack pipe too many times on. 

Older versions on Model S's work great on the highways (highways are much easier for FSD) and Enhanced AP is solid. FSD is work in progress and I know how hard it is to get software like this to work perfectly  - so it is going to be a while before your Tesla turns into a robo taxi : )"
"On highways and roads with clearly defined lines FSD works fairly well. I had it drive from Manhattan through a tunnel to Long Island NY, not an easy drive, and it didn‚Äôt disengage at all. On side streets missing lines, heavy traffic that limits easy opportunity to change lanes etc it comes up short"
It is truly ok at best and more of a nuisance than anything else. How they charge $12-$15k for it is unreal.
10 years sounds like a nice realistic round number based on a lot of inputs....
"At this point, I just accept the fact that people see things with personal filters. There is no way in hell I can be impressed with FSD. I even used FSD with a rented model X on the same route that some YouTuber did in some of their videos. It does not work period. But hey, just my experience and opinion. I do not have a horse in this race."
It's amazing at what it does and enhances the freeway experience as well. Especially on those long freeway trips that might have stop and go. Around town is challenging and i see people crash all the time. It so far has avoided any crash. It's different and takes a bit of nerve and getting used to and how to use it to YOUR best advantage.
I‚Äôve had it for almost 2 years! Last year was amazing! The last 4 updates have ruined it! It now swerves into turn lanes going 60 mph and then realizes it can‚Äôt recover and turns off. It never used to do this. Now it‚Äôs dangerous!
"It sounds like you were at one intersection or turn that FSD might‚Äôve had a problem with, I‚Äôll bet you use it longer It will prove to be much better. It drives Myself and my wife back-and-forth to work with no interventions consistently. Or maybe you are just judging it on how it would take a turn versus you taking a turn versus what is actually safe? Just because it‚Äôs doing things that are not the norm doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not safe."
"I recently decided to get the monthly subscription to try it out on my new MYLR. 12k is way too much for what you get. 

I have a couple disengagements each day I use it. A couple over the last week that could have been really bad. I pay attention so I'll continue to use it for the month and then no resub but it's been interesting trying it out."
"I drive to and from Montreal and Toronto rather often, and barring bad weather and intrusive construction, it's been able to do door to door driving with at most 2/3 interventions (and usually I intervene out of impatience at an unprotected left or to manually handle a particularly bumpy/pot-holey section for a smoother ride).

I've found it doesn't do well in tight residential streets (parking on both sides results in 1 car at a time on a two-way street) or when lines are erroneously or oddly drawn.

It could use cameras looking left and right from the bumper, which would help in many situations."
I use it all day everyday. It‚Äôs awesome.  I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre taking about bro.
At least you get to play with it... in the EU FSD still is vaporware...i wouldnt want a car without autopilot but seeing as how slow or non working autopark is in small parking spots(where you would actually like the car to park for you) and slow or non working auto lane change is on busy highway..... i still dont think fsd is usable on smaller city streets with bicycles and pedestrians and small curbs that are sometimes used instead of roadlines
"Only use autopilot on highway driving. Don‚Äôt have FSD, but wouldn‚Äôt ever trust it on Canadian roads most of the year."
"It‚Äôs still Beta. Paying $12k for it is a bet on the future. Nobody should be buying it for what it is now. From seeing the rate of progress, I‚Äôm betting my car will drive better than I within 2-3 years to the point where I‚Äôd be find sleeping while it drives. It‚Äôs so so so much better than it was a year ago."
"your car prob hates you and tried to kill you unsuccessfully

I have had FSD since the early days where we had to take a freaking test with driving metrics meticulously tested and scored in order to be allowed a fsd download -- since then i have seen massive changes and improvements - and since i got my fsd suite for a low LOW price of $4k .. its well fucking worth it. 

&#x200B;

so frankly if youre new at this you have ZERO FUCKING IDEA of how bad it TRULY was."
"I have a loaner with it right now. It's impressive based on what it does and what it cna do, but I don't trust it on some more complicated intersections, and Jersey traffic is aggressive.

What is realllllly nice is the highway driving. I have standard AP and I find the stopping and going to be janky and jerky. It also slows down waaaay too late. None of this is present on the FSD stack. Hoping we eventually get that highway driving on standard AP."
"I took delivery of a MY LR with FSD last week. I have found FSD to be unusable. It is way too cautious in 90% of intersections. It is confused in mountain drives. It slows down randomly on highways. 

This was not a smart $12k purchase on my part."
"What bothers me is when the sun is low, I can't even have standard cruise control without the car wanted to slow down cause of visibility. This is why I hate that they disabled the lidar in my 2018M3P, that didn't care about the sun.  And this experience tells me that camera only FSD is not possible...hell, since last update my wipers only seem to auto wipe when dry...when wet ... Nope."
"There was no FSD 7 years ago. In October of 2016 the cars had Hardware 1 and the Autopilot Convenience Feature. That system was based on self-driving hardware from MobilEye with some Tesla software added. It only worked on highways but at the time weaved back and forth in its lane. It had basic summon, Autosteer, Autopark, Traffic aware Cruise control, speed assist (it could read speed limit signs) and driver-initiated lane change. It didn't turn at intersections, stop at stop signs and didn't recognize traffic lights. It didn't recognize many types of objects in the road.

I drove that system until I got my Model 3 with Hardware 2.5 in 2016, later upgraded by Tesla to Hardware 3.0. The software then was divided between Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) and FSD. They later released Navigate on Autopilot that added highway features, specifically automatic lane change, passing slower traffic, automatic exits and merges and exits to follow a route. Later they added stop light control (stops for lights).  I joined the FSD Beta limited test group in December of 2021 and now I drive a Model Y with HW4 and FSD 11.4.4 (the latest beta is not available on HW4).

Over the last 5 years I have seen addition of features (like Advanced Summon that can drive in parking lots with no driver to a location indicated with the app) added and the basic features improved. Early EAP had a hard time staying on a road with sharp curves and the driving was very jerky. It handled stop signs and made turns at intersections. Advanced visualizations show on the screen the locations of other cars, trash cans, traffic cones, traffic signs, pedestrians, dogs and painted street turn lines.

I did a 5000 mile road trip in 2019 with EAP. It made the difference between a driving ordeal and a relaxing trip.

With early FSD, the car couldn't make turns at intersections onto high-speed roads. It confused flashing yellow caution signs with yellow traffic lights. I could make a very long list of repeated problems with the system that gradually over time got worked out. But yesterday, my car drove me 28 miles from my home into town on a mix of rural streets, sharply curved highways, interstate highway and city streets and then back again without disengagement.

FSD stills makes mistakes as the OP noted, but it is far easier to anticipate and correct its mistakes than it is to drive the car yourself. And I fully believe that FSD PLUS ME is safer than either of us alone. 

For someone with physical limitations, it can make the difference between being able to drive and not. So is it worth $12,000? I paid only $8k in 2018 so I may not be the best person to ask, but I think it is -- for me.

As for the future, I don't think *anyone* outside of Tesla really knows when or if any currently equipped FSD car becomes a level 4 autonomous vehicle. The 300,000 lines of code that drive the car today are being scrapped, totally scrapped, in favor of AI and machine learning. It's a totally new ballgame."

"I feel that FSD v12 is equivalent to a new, 16 year old driver and v13 is like a 19 year old."
"Yes. Yes it is. I just completed a well over 1300 mile road trip with it. Kept in Standard speed profile and it was flawless.  Seriously mind blowing.

EDIT: AI4 on FSD 13.2.2. I have made this trip many times, but this is the first time it was intervention free; just normal disengagement when I got to the Superchargers because it does not pull into a charger stall on its own yet except at the Fort Mill (Carowinds) SC Supercharger. 

I was never able to achieve this with FSD 12. The improvement is massive."
"I‚Äôve done about 1600 miles on v13 and it is such an incredible step change over v12 once you start driving at volume. It was incredibly helpful navigating unfamiliar cities, handles highways competently (including moving out of passing lanes which is so much better), is more safe and considerate than most drivers. It‚Äôs comfortable, smooth, and confident. 

It still has hiccups, but in 1600 miles I can tell you every disengagement because they‚Äôre rare. 1. There was an obstruction in the road and it pushed it into the oncoming lane and it didn‚Äôt get back over for some reason 2. It tried pulling onto a highway shoulder early before an exit 3. It avoided a semi drifting into our lane too aggressively and moved into the shoulder 4. It got stuck at a 5 way intersection that had flashing yellow lights and red lights facing us in both directions (I don‚Äôt know how a human is supposed to navigate that properly, tbh). 

Hard to knock it for one disengagement per 400 miles of driving and I can see how they get to next holiday season with a version surpassing 1000 miles per disengagement handily. I won‚Äôt make any assertions about unsupervised but the supervised version is finally starting to feel good."
"It is better than 12, hands down.
Took it on a few drives today and yesterday and everything was flawless. It even got wife approval, which is most incredible.

Now, it just needs to nail the parking."
"FSD 12 was incredible for a short time before the update where it lost the ability to maintain a speed setpoint. Still a few quirks, but overall very impressive."
just do a demo drive with a car that has v13.2.2 - see how it does in your neighborhood
"12.6x is supposed to be released by end of year per Ashok, head of Tesla FSD for hw3

If you sell the car you will take a 20k hit so just hang ion to it"
"FSD v12 was a game changer, just as much as v13 is compared to v12.

V12 you can automate roughly 90% of your driving, with some small annoyances like how it handles stops and turns but you get used to it. V12 was also too conservative and you often had to step on the gas to give it confidence.

V13 just brings it to 98-100% of your driving time, is more confident and most of my driving I don‚Äôt have to touch the brake, steering wheel or gas even once. 

Considering since v12 is good enough to automate 90% of driving, I don‚Äôt think its worth it upgrading especially since Elon has stated they will be upgrading HW3 cars at some point for free if you purchased FSD. Just keep in mind though the cameras on HW3 will never be upgradable, it‚Äôs only the computer hardware that would be replaced to allow HW3 run v13 at some point. Also AI can optimize itself and eventually run on HW3 on its own too.

But if I had extra cash laying around and it didn‚Äôt matter if I wasted some money, yeah I‚Äôd buy a new car just for v13, I hate driving."
"It‚Äôs that good.  I have a 2022 S with 12
and a 2024 3 with 13.  13 feels magical.  It just works.  For the first time I can see the light at the end of the FSD road"
Going from V12 to V13 is like going from flip phone to smartphone
"FSD13? 

Not worth upgrading your car.

FSD18, 22, etc? 

Absolutely worth upgrading to continue getting new releases.

When to upgrade is a personal decision, similar to iPhones. 

HW3 will be left behind, as will HW4 and HW5. Nobody knows when and where those cruel events will happen.

I will likely get a new MY next year, we still have ICE in the family fleet  that need to be replaced. It will be Juniper. May be an FSD transfer from the 2020 and put that on subscription."
"Yes, I‚Äôve used it for 2 drives and it‚Äôs absolutely incredible"
"Why would you sell the car? FSD 13 should come to HW3, no?"
"> at the time Elon and everybody was touting how FSD 12 was a game changer and was amazing. However, FSD 12 is not even close to good enough IMO.

This is correct.

FSD 12 was a game changer and was amazing.

FSD 13 is a game changer and is amazing.

FSD 14 will be a game changer and will be amazing.

So will be FSD 15."
"Current FSD, be it V12 or V13, is much like being a driving instructor with a 16 year old with a learners permit. Sure you could have long stretches where the leaner drives perfectly but you have to constantly be attentive and be ready to slam on the brakes or pull on the steering wheel because you never know what kind of stupid shit that kid might do."
How about waiting a bit longer to see what adaptations are in store for your HW3 before buying a new car.
V13 is smooth as a butter and react very quickly vs v12 is harse and slow to react.
Cries in HW3
"FSD V13 drove me home tonight.  It pulled into my driveway up to the garage door and between my two cars (I have a single and double bay, and there was a car on either end.)

Amazing!"
FSD 13 is almost night and day from v12
"It almost killed me today, it didn‚Äôt know which lane to take me when a road split and chose the middle üíÄ also it‚Äôs missed 2 freeway exits for me.

That said it‚Äôs so much better than 12 and nails almost every standard drive, just needs better lane management and map data"
It‚Äôs definitely an improvement on my usual routes. It navigates old pitfalls flawlessly. Each update has its quirks and as more people get it we‚Äôll see more cracks show.
To Elon the Next One is always the best.
Last year‚Äôs model cannot be software upgraded to 13 without buying a new car?
It's good in the city but terrible on the highway at higher speeds. It rides right up against the line rather than centred in lane.
"It just drove me 2 hours on a road trip. While 12 was able to do this, 13 did it more naturally. Whereas turns were small jerky adjustments of the wheel on 12, on 13 it was a smooth motion. The car also didn't make senseless left lane changes driving below the speed limit with no one in front and angering drivers behind me. The only lane changes I saw were to bypass slow cars or to exit, you know, like a real person might. 13 also didn't nag me as much for not looking in front. 12 was like a army sgt on duty making sure I don't move my pupils. 13, I can move my head and be relaxed.

I'll be honest. I was really impressed with 12. But I was only impressed that a car can drive itself but it drove like a nervous robot and an a-hole. 13 seems to drive like a real person."
V12 can‚Äôt drive out of my neighborhood. No where near ready to be really autonomous. V13 can‚Äôt be much better. Lots of hype. Can work in lots of simple cases but one little mess up at 70mph can do you in quick.
"Over 100 miles, literally 0 disengagements. I‚Äôve had to basically push the accelerator when it‚Äôs been timid or something but nothing else."
"You can probably test drive FSD 13 at any Tesla demo drive location, my personal experience with the current build is yeah it‚Äôs actually a huge step up, v12 was kind of annoying but v13 is actually useful.

I probably wouldn‚Äôt upgrade an already new car for it unless it was financially negligible, HW3 is gonna be far behind but not totally forgotten so improvements will come"
"Bruh, I have used it for one day and it is amazing. Get a new computer/car."
"It‚Äôs fixed every single issue I had. It still ignores stop except right turn and no turn on red and on place it seems there‚Äôs a mapping issue, but all the little errors it used to make are gone.  Here‚Äôs some uncut driving if you would like to see rural driving. https://youtu.be/C2RwBkRXfa4?si=YMaiQuhGDvOUUESP"
Understand that 12 vs 11 was a generational leap.
I wouldn't go selling your car and getting a new one. It's not like they said hw3 will not be able to have v13 fsd. The only statement that was made is that they don't know if it will be able to do fsd unsupervised. That's but where we are at.
Still waiting in HW3 üò≤
Was FSD 13 pushed out for those with HW3? I wonder if there‚Äôs any difference you notice between cars on FSD 13 with HW3 vs. HW4? I recall reading how HW4 has much higher image resolution and would benefit immensely from more raw data for vision based driving than HW3.
"I just took my 2024 M3 - FSD v13 for a drive .  It‚Äôs the first drive in this version , north west fort with to east Keller .  35min drive .  Traffic was easy , but the only time I stopped it was to brake in order to cross a set of horrible railroad tracks at speed acceptable for this track , instead of 45mph.  We cross at about 8 mph .  Other than that , I was impressed .  It was so smooth handles a divided left turn with oncoming and side traffic .  Handled like a champ. It was so smooth and calm.  It‚Äôs smoother than I can drive manually because I‚Äôm harder on acceleration and braking.  
The other thing is how it was able to get into my gated drive street.  On versions 12 it could never do it .  As many times as I tried,  almost daily for 2 months .  It never once learned .  
Today,  as it approached the entry-way,  it started to do it right then got confused just like before.  I gave it a nudge on the steering wheel and then it stopped backed up and proceeded forward .  I was so amused,  I circled the block and this time , slowed only got semi -confused.  As I nudged the wheel , it then proceeded to make the turn 100% , as if it was really learning .  If next time it gets it right, I‚Äôll have to say OMG.   Overall seems like a drastic improvement .  I‚Äôm going to have to do some major test with it now.  My commute next Monday will be about the next test . 

Sadly , It Still turns on my wipers when it shouldn‚Äôt .  The other day I was manually driving . Not even in AP didn‚Äôt have FSD . The car TURNED on my wipers and smeared what ever was on the passengers side all over my driver side of the window .  It wasn‚Äôt bothering me at all.  At this point I had to wash the window .  Not very happy , glad I had washer fluid ."
"Happy holidays. I‚Äôm awaiting delivery but.. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can answer this question yourself by watching the hundreds of FSD videos to hit YouTube in the last few days. It is absolutely mind blowing. The old FSD can‚Äôt hold a candle to it, and it‚Äôs very unfortunate you can‚Äôt upgrade with your vehicle being  just one year old.. I would raise hell trying to get into a new one if that‚Äôs the case.

In an odd set of circumstances, I last minute chose to lease instead of finance.. I am so glad I did because who knows how far Tesla will come in the next three years.

Hope everything works out for you. Also, don‚Äôt believe everything Elon says."
Biggest thing for me is just that it can leave a parking spot and theoretically park at a destination. Does a bad job parking in my experience but it's getting closer to a seamless experience.
"I've been pretty harsh on FSD. I purchased my Model 3 in 2019 with FSD ($6k at the time). I bought a 2024 Model 3 with FSD transfer.

It's been a lot of back and forth. Features regressing or disappearing. I used NOA (navigate on autopilot, FSD for highways only when GPS nav was set, essentially) for an early 2020 WA-CA trip. It was impressive, and all downhill from there for years.

But FSD 12.3.6 earlier this year changed my mind. It was a massive leap forward. I could now use FSD on daily trips with impressive, though inconsistent, results. I could do a 60 minute drive with 3-5 interventions.

I got FSD 13.2.2.1 the other day. And so far it feels like a massive leap forward. I did a 1.5 hour, 70 mile drive though various roads (back roads to highways) and it was flawless. Zero interventions. Weather was mixed, started sunny and ended up raining. Had a pedestrian walking down the road toward me, and the car slowed slightly while drifting into the oncoming lane to give him space. It was all natural and impressive.

One drive won't convince me, but it has me interested. They are headed in the right direction."
"there is a video of 13.2.2 driving on the busy manhattan streets on youtube, it's pretty good."
"It's gotten vastly better but there are new bugs at every release.

My latest version arbitrarily switches lanes while on curved highway entrances/exits without putting on any blinkers. This is new.

Next version this will probably be fixed, and some new bug will show up.

It's interesting."
"I thought it was fantastic until it attempted to drive into oncoming traffic when it turned left too soon for a left turn. I've only had it for two days, but it's been on that route many times before so I'm not sure why it did that.  Still needs work, but it is much better than v12."
"> at the time Elon and everybody was touting how FSD 12 was a game changer and was amazing

It was. Absolutely revolutionary from a software architecture standpoint, and huge improvement in natural driving ability. That doesn't mean it's perfect though. But it was a massive step forward. 

V13 obviously isn't as revolutionary (the core architecture is still an end-to-end neural network like V12), but it is a large step forward beyond V12 and is especially notable for its driving smoothness."
Realistically it‚Äôs twice as good. Which is an insane improvement. It makes $99 a month a no brainer for me. I really hope they don‚Äôt raise the price now though with the huge improvement.
"Better, but not that good."
"FSD 13 is sick, but I am not sure I would cough up new money. Go test drive one and see for yourself. I have had HW4 only, and I remember jump from 12.3 to 12.5 was much more human like. Then 12.5 to 13 even more so. 13 at times is hard to explain. 

On 13 I was in the left lane on I5 going like 75 in a 60, had someone riding me wanting to pass, the car got over to the middle lane much faster than it would have before, let the guy pass and immediately got back over in the left lane. It was wild how human like it was. It was raining like crazy too. 

That‚Äôs not a big deal (wouldn‚Äôt want to sell a car over it), but it‚Äôs things like that you have to experience for yourself. 

Honestly, if you are a big FSD fan it‚Äôs really about your financial situation. It is a big upgrade from the versions I have used."
"I‚Äôm actually curious. Does anyone know if the car locally learns its surroundings the more you use it? I have HW3 with v12, and it seems like it does sometimes, then at other parts of the drive (same spot) it always acts surprised that it has to move over/lane ends. So maybe it doesn‚Äôt?"
I've been subscribed for a few months now and usually always disengage and get frustrated. V13 is the first time I've felt like it was actually useful. Keeps up with the speed and I can change speed profiles and max settings at will with the scroll wheel. Very happy with this update so far. Your results may vary
Yep
"Each update is better than the last. Every month I think, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll unsubscribe from FSD‚Äù. Then a new update happens and I find myself becoming more addicted to the self-driving.  Since FSD13, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve driven without it on and these improvements keep me subscribed even when I know I don‚Äôt really need it. But do I?  I find myself really enjoying FSD far more than I care to admit.  I‚Äôve had to intervene at times but I can pretty much anticipate when the cars going to have an issue. In regular freeway driving in SoCal it‚Äôs pretty much flawless.  Now if I could get the car to self-park onto my garage.  

I‚Äôm realizing FSD will eventually become a great source of revenue for Tesla. It‚Äôs addicting to use & takes a lot of stress out of driving in high traffic metro areas. I‚Äôm an example of how you get sucked into the subscription.

Also, because I‚Äôve enjoyed it so much,  I now find myself using Smart Summon.  Instead of walking to the car in a large parking lot, it usually meets me half way."
I just went to my families Christmas dinner about 1.5 away and it navigated it fully from driveway to driveway. Literally backed into the driveway to park. Seriously great improvement and overall feel more stable when accelerating and de accelerating
"No. It‚Äôs where i originally thought it should have been at back when you had to be invited to the beta. Elon is flat out an over-exaggerator to a flat out liar. Each release is always ‚Äúfire‚Äù if you see his tweets, but in reality the tend to get more bugs the more they try to fix until the try something new in a new base version number release."
Asking that question in this sub is like asking in the Boston Bruins sub what the best hockey team is. Answers are so skewed
Just gonna call out that daytime vs nighttime is very different.
Nah you'd be better off keeping what you have until the refresh after the next one. HW5 is currently in development.
If you have FSD on hw3 and Tesla can‚Äôt make it work wasn‚Äôt people entitled to a free upgrade.
"I just got v13 on my 24 model 3. It seems to be better in most areas except that now it has trouble staying center in a lane sometimes, when this wasn't an issue at all before."
I am waiting the day when it drives like India driver of Nepalis mountain bus drivers
I better get a retrofit for my hw3 2021 model 3
I‚Äôm in the camp of having hw3 apparently. All I know is FSD worked significantly better before this last update on v12‚Ä¶ it is starting to feel like it‚Äôs on purpose to make people want to upgrade to a car that has the newer version.
First thing my free v13 trial does is stop 16 miles behind a stop sign and nearly gets plowed as it goes through because it couldn‚Äôt see any cross traffic. Not a great start for me üòÇ but I‚Äôll keep testing it. Got a long drive today so we‚Äôll see how it goes
"Yes. But so was 12.5.x so to me, I don‚Äôt expect to see anything major since there isn‚Äôt anything major to address. It‚Äôs handling the basics really good. It‚Äôs tweaking and fine tuning. Handling more rare situations, construction zone, pot holes, things humans do without really thinking and we take for granted. It‚Äôs only been a few days so we‚Äôll see if v13 regresses or improves in these areas. 

That said I would like to see improvements in multi lane roundabouts and areas where the speed limit drops. Those two things and the areas I drive most frequently would be perfect. It still refuses to slow down from a 45 to 35 despite knowing the speed drops. And one roundabout it takes over the whole thing and lays claim to all lanes."
"Having been in since the original beta where you had to have a driver score, I think v13 is astounding compared to any previous versions. I‚Äôve literally ‚Äúdriven‚Äú my car 5 miles out of the last 500 since 13 came out.  I‚Äôve been used it in the fog this morning in Denver, and it worked great."
"13 is great but not perfect. I love it and use it on my MYP w/HW4, but, why not wait and see what the next update brings? Why change your  vehicle when soon you can choose from the updated 3 or Juniper (Y) which will be selling at great prices because the sales of EV 's has gone kerplunk? The only thing is if the $7500 tax credit goes away, I guess a 25 Y or 3 w/HW4 makes sense bec Tesla is discounting as well and you can  get a double benefit.

Hey, unless you can really afford to buy, don't get intoxicated w/ having FSD and HW4. There is more to life! Soon there will be HW5 and maybe ultrasound as well. I am a senior with no other expense . Kids are grown, so while not rich, I can upgrade my vehicle. Firgive the preaching and I don't know your situation but remember until you can eatch TV while driving, FSD is a gimmick!!!!"
What‚Äôs wrong with you ? Why would ya sell and rebuy because of software?
"Drove 13.2.2 for first time yesterday. Noticeably smoother but dove into 2 dedicated turn lanes at the last minute 1 right,1 left) and completely missed a right hand turn lane and tried to turn from the straight lane. As a bonus ran right over a small dead animal. Still requires 100% attention.  This was on a 30 minute drive."
"I drove all through the night last night coming home from Family Christmas - and it was horrible for me on the interstate in dark areas. Bouncing all over within the lane, and on sharp corners going so far outside the lane, it hit rumble strips. Also, it cannot keep a constant speed. The drivers around me were constantly passing, only for FSD to immediately pass them back"
"You‚Äôre in a Tesla forum, you‚Äôre going to get hevily biased answers. It‚Äôs better but still nowhere near perfect and makes questionable mistakes"
"2018 Tesla Model X. The car indicates that we can upgrade our hardware and then get FSD - any idea what hardware version we will get and and based on that, would FSD be useful on that specific hardware?"
"It's good. A few disengage, as there always will be, but I think some folks have unrealistic expectations...but yes, it's good on AI4 at least."
"Side question: is the insanely sensitive attention tracking going to ever be relaxed? Has this been announced anywhere for future improvement? Yesterday I tried changing the XM station (the UI of the XM app is a different axe to grind) and my car yelled at me for that. Later my wife saw a deer and pointed it out to me to watch out in case it decides to run in the road and when I looked for about 2 seconds it yelled at me again. I get it, something is probably needed but it‚Äôs way overboard as is."
At this point it drives better than the average driver on the roads.
"I don‚Äôt get it, I have a Model Y with HW3 and I have always loved FSD v12. Maybe I‚Äôm easy to impress but I believe it‚Äôs revolutionary . Very minimal hiccups for me,  mainly just that sometimes on long curves at highway speeds it hugs the line close to the wall, and there is a sudden switch on that curve it gets close to hitting I always have disengage but that‚Äôs a rare occurrence, and lately it‚Äôs been cutting off people when lane changing and that‚Äôs on the relaxed autopilot setting and sometimes seems to brake late when coming up on stopped cars, aside from those scenarios it performs amazingly, and for long trips it‚Äôs perfect mostly. If they don‚Äôt give us fsd 13 I‚Äôm going to lose it and y‚Äôall can enter my class action lawsuit ;)"
"Drove 80 miles home last night through the Bronx and Queens out to Long Island.  First time trying FSD 13 and I was very impressed over the previous versions.  I touched the wheel once when it seemed to be making a weird lane choice getting off the George Washington Bridge.  Other than that perfect.  Used it in ""Standard"" mode for most of the ride but switched to ""Hurry"" for the last bit.  Hurry too was very good and maybe better to keep up with NYC driving."
"You will not understand how good FSD is until you get into a car without it.

I have a 2020 myp and drive it daily since it was first available. I have been shopping around to upgrade to a different car but literally every new EV I have been in is a disappointment when it comes to the software."
"I had FSD 12.3.xx when I took delivery of my first Tesla within 2 days I received the FSD 12.5.4.2 update and even that incremental update was a noticeable improvement. 12.5.4.2 did a much better job at keeping at or slightly above the speed limit and was just much smoother overall. I got FSD 13.2.2.1 a few days ago and it's even smoother in terms of acceleration, braking, and turning. There's also a lot less hesitation overall when it's deciding to do something. On the Hurry profile it smoothly maneuvers around slower cars but speed is still a little inconsistent, at least it almost always drives above the speed limits now. 

My only issue with it so far is that it drives really slow in neighborhoods...in my neighborhood (25 mph speed limit) it refuses to drive faster than 10 mph unless I press on the accelerator.

I've been using FSD well over 90% of the time since I picked up my Tesla at the beginning of the month - so far I've been pretty impressed with what it can do, the vast majority of the time it does what it's supposed to safely and efficiently."
13 is smoother than 12 and so far i have been able to drive without much manual interaction through highways and streets a like in MA.
"It‚Äôs really good. Drove me from Delaware to Philly south Philly last night. I mean, I got off the wrong exit to the phl airport and didn‚Äôt slow down before a speed bump but I can let that slide. It was much more assertive than v12"
Situationally dependent.
"I feel like it depends on what you‚Äôre asking it to do. I have only used the 2 free 30-day trials on my HW3 Model 3, but I have been impressed with how well it works overall. In easy driving situations, like light interstate traffic, it really does a great job. 

In more demanding situations such as around town in moderate traffic, it navigated some crazy intersections with aplomb, but also there were times where FSD looked like it was gonna do something unadvisable. I didn‚Äôt want to wait and see what happened and that‚Äôs where I took over from it.

All-in-all, I have been favorably impressed with FSD 12, but I‚Äôm not ready to pay for it yet."
"I'd say that v13 is FAR from autonomous.  But in saying that, I've been using FSD since late 2021, and WOW!!! has it come a long way.  Recent drives have been nothing short of amazing."
HW4 yea. It‚Äôs great tbh
I‚Äôm newer to Teslas. But isn‚Äôt 12 vs 13 just a matter of an update? Do you need a new car?
It‚Äôs good on HW4.  I have a 2023 MY with the HW4 computer.  I had an older M3 with HW3 and I can see a big improvement once they started developing the HW4 versions.  Prior to that they were developing on HW3 and running on HW4 in an emulation mode.  Now it takes advantage of the upgraded HW4 and cameras.  It‚Äôs still not perfect but is noticeably improved to me for my long drives.
Still waiting for it
"It's good... as far as idiot award I get it, bought a  2018 x and a 2020 3p in October 22, paid 72k and 54k the following month Tesla had their big price drop and both cars dropped value like a rock, fast forward to June 24 sold both (with paid FSD) and purchased new 3p and y, 2 days after delivery the offered free FSD transfer üò°üò°üò°"
"I thought about the same, but I am more intrigued on getting my car upgraded to hw3.5 or whatever the hell they gonna call it. FSD was 15k at the time‚Ä¶"
"Used 13 today for the first time. For the first time, my wife and I forgot we weren't driving. Felt smooth and natural on our city streets. It was incredible."
"It's a completely different animal up in the mountains. V12 could drive these roads, but was agonizingly slow. Very slow on the straights, even slower on curves, and would not speed back up after a curve.

It could just about keep up with a caravan of people with gigantic toy haulers.

Nearly useless, except when stuck behind the toy hauler people.

Now, it's just fine. Drives mountain roads at normal car speeds.

Sure, it's better all over the place, but in my local area it went from nearly useless to doing all the driving."
"It is pretty good.
Media reporting, imho, seems to want to report it as failing.
If fact, i was against teslas and auto drive, until a friend took me 35 miles, door to door and only had to turn it off to park.  Blew my mind.

Do you have to pay attention. Yes.  Can you just let it do its thing? 98% of the time yep. The other 2%, is just being smart.
Ie dont fsd if traffic around you is being stupid.  Dont use it if the car in front of you is that random asshole that emergency brakes at the last minute, every time. Etc.
But for boring traffic - its fricken awesome.  And yes, for the most part it will get you from a to b, with no issues. Assuming that the roads are all fairly standard.

I use fsd about 50% of the time.  The longest was a trip from Phoenix to Pahrump nv.  Fsd except for pulling into the super charger in kingman, and the garage in pahrump.  

EPIC"
"Sadly, HW3 is a dead end for FSD, just not enough compute power. People who talk about how amazing FSD is are on HW4."
It‚Äôs ok. Still changes lanes way too often for my liking. Speed profiles suck for fast LA freeways.
"I have been using FSD 13 for past 2 days in NYC. Drove around 200 miles and of that I took over for maybe 10 miles. Mostly because certain idiotic drivers blocking road on a green light. FSD was being a good driver and waiting but I know on those intersections, you have to break some unsaid rules to get by,

  
For the remaining 180-190 miles it drove and made decisions exactly as I would and felt very human like. I was still extremely cautious though, I am a SE and something about Blackbox AI and vision systems bother me to the point that I would never completely hand over my safety to it."
"It's highly variable depending on where you are in the country. I'm on 13.2.2 and have no manual driving in 5 days with it. No interventions, not so much as a pedal press. But I've talked with others in less Tesla heavy areas with much different results."
"V13.2.1 was much better but still had ‚Äúderp‚Äù moments here and there, though not nearly as often as V12. The latest (V13.2.2 as of now) has been amazing and nearly perfect everywhere. Worst ‚Äúintervention‚Äù is a light accelerator tap at a roundabout or a super confusing trafficky intersection. Otherwise I don‚Äôt even need to initiate lane changes, and definitely don‚Äôt have to hover over the accelerator like in previous versions. This is the first version that makes me happy. I have driven over an hour both highway and city with heavy and light traffic without touching a single control. 

Parking lot performance aside. You still want to disengage when you get into a lot as it doesn‚Äôt seem any better than before."
12 to 13 is definitely a big jump. My wife isn‚Äôt a major Tesla head and has no clue on anything related any type of fsd version and she enjoys 13. She immediately notices the smoother stopping or slowing down as well as a smoother transition when going for zero to the speed limit. Me personally I‚Äôd definitely say it‚Äôs a great stable improvement. The negatives for me would be the parking isn‚Äôt the greatest. Took it to Waffle House the other day and it double parked lol
"Just did a coast to coast 4,000 mile road trip. \~10 interventions. Felt like a forcefield. Less exhausting, easily drove 14hrs/day. Its SO GOOD"
13 is absolutely nuts in my opinion
"It struggles reading ""minimum"" speed signs and kept trying to drop to 40 on the highway, I'd adjust, and then it'd do it again when it saw the correct 70 sign. Repeat for hours. Phantom braking with some logic. 

Still hates staying in right lane unless on chill, in which case it drives below the speed I set. 

It does a great job passing and getting back over. I hate that I can't cancel passes anymore without disengaging.

I still don't trust it in cities with any traffic around."
"Don't do it, next year or the next it will be hw5 and fsd 14 or something so that Elon can sell you the latest version of his iPhone. Hw3 was literally sold about a year ago and the fact that they say it can't do fsd 13 makes me call bullshit, they just want you to buy the latest model year."
It‚Äôs not that good.
13.2.2 or whatever just came out was bad from Wickenberg to Kingman. Constantly drifting off the highway or into the next lane. I had to takeover on nearly every curve in the road.
"I was enjoying 12.5.3 before 13 was released. Now it's back to not maintaining speed, so I've switched back to Autopilot"

"My first impressions:

  
Positives:

- Autopark seems \~20% faster

- Maneuvering around in traffic seems much better/smoother. Stopping/decision making seemed more confident/human like. This is the first real noticeable improvement I've seen since the v12 rollout a few months ago.

Negatives:

- My first drive to the local shopping center was going really well. At the stoplight intersection I heard a few sudden loud noises coming from the brake pedal while I was stopped, like the car was going to move. It didn't move, but it was alarming and happened a few times. 

- Autopark worked great/faster. When I came out and got in the car to drive home a bunch of errors popped up:

  
APP\_w305 Autopilot cameras unavilable

APP\_w009 Automatic Emergency Braking is unavailable

  
It told me features would be available on a future ride. I tried a soft and hard reboot with no luck. Parked the car in the garage, went out a few hours later and still no autopilot auto wipers, or even basic cruise control. I feel like this update needs some more work."
"I tried it for \~1.5 hours of drive. its noticeably better than 12.3.6, more assertive and confident and smoother. It still make 1 stupid mistake where it went to the wrong lane. I took over, so not sure if eventually it would have corrected itself. Also in the highway, when there is traffic forming in front it goes faster that I would and breaks. Makes it more likely for the car behind to rear end me. I am on the assertive option. Overall id say its a good improvement. P.S also not a yourtuber or tester, Model 3 LR 2024"
Won‚Äôt hold my breath. 12.4.3(?) also had good first impressions and influencers were telling them to send it.
In for the ride. One day people will notice and the stock is gonna pop.
Looking good!
"Installing 2024.20.10 (FSD 12.5) on my 3 highland now. Will update tomorrow.

Edit - I bought my first Tesla (2024 rwd m3) in March of this year, not a YouTuber or original Beta tester. It seems to be rolling out more widely than Elon said in his tweets, or I got it by mistake"
Just got it installed. Will give update.
"I got 12.5 and I‚Äôm not impressed.  A lot of stupid choices, and take overs.  I was on the highway and cars were passing in the left rapidly.  FSD kept signaling and trying to pull in the left lane despite cars approaching at high speed.  It got confused with construction vehicles and slammed in the brakes in highway traffic due to a parked  truck on the shoulder. 

I‚Äôll keep trying but I‚Äôm very disappointed so far."
"I have to admit I can‚Äôt really tell the difference , it seems a little smoother and confident but that could be placebo effect."
"Great for people with HW 4 cars.  For the rest of us, these reviews mean nothing."
I still don‚Äôt have 12.4 yet üòü
Until it is rolled back.
Same old story getting old. This feels like crying wolf where when it does get good no one will know
Dunno the sunglasses feature is rather disappointing
">	I tried to wear sunglasses and it disabled driver monitoring, meaning it still has steering wheel nags with sunglasses on 

Smh. ü§¶

Why is everything Elon says about fsd on his shitty microblog website verifiable bullshit?"
[deleted]
I agree with you OP on all points. I‚Äôve got a four month trial of FSD and find myself using it all the time. I still don‚Äôt think I can justify $8k but if that price comes down maybe.
I use it every day. It‚Äôs amazing
"Plenty of people on Reddit love it, and plenty find it basically unusable. It just depends on the specifics of where you are and your expectations.

Personally, I couldn‚Äôt get it to drive without intervention for more than a couple of minutes on my commute (except on freeways, where autopilot works), which makes it unusable for me, but others have it driving their whole route. YMMV, literally."
"I agree. I basically used it everyday I had it during my free trial. Is it perfect? Of course not. But it does about 95% right, so I can take over the other 5% if need be."
"I‚Äôve probably got about 35,000 miles on FSD.

Absolutely love it"
I was really impressed with it and subscribed after the trial.¬†
I use it every day driving around town and rarely have to intervene. When I do it‚Äôs more just me being cautious. When driving on the highway it‚Äôs the perfect break when you just wanna unwind for a little bit. Will definitely be subscribing on 6/20 when my trial expires
Love it
"I use it all the time. Most of my drives don‚Äôt have an intervention, however I‚Äôll take over in areas where I may not feel fully comfortable like merging on the highway or getting around some dense urban areas with tons of pedestrians. I‚Äôm pretty sure FSD can handle those scenarios but that‚Äôs just my comfort level.

I think people are expecting full level 5, which is clearly not at. However for $100/mo I am satisfied with it, especially as it continues to improve."
I love it.  In urban driving where there‚Äôs a lot of traffic it takes a lot of stress and energy away from the driver making the drive more enjoyable. I really like it. Is it worth paying $99 per month.  Probably not for me.  At $25 per month I‚Äôd subscribe full time.
I drive with FSD on almost every single drive now. It is truly amazing and I wish more people could see what it‚Äôs like. It‚Äôs mind blowing now. I LOVE FSD! I paid $6K for it in Oct 2019. Everyone who rides with me now and sees what it does is just blown away!
FSD trial was hit and miss for me. I was able to drive my daily commute mostly without needing to intervene but once the number of lanes go above 2 it started to act funny and sudden ghost breaking just drove me nuts. There are ways to go to call this a real product but it is not too bad now. I might pay $2k for something like this.
"It's better than I expected, but I won't be subscribing. The way it drives just stresses me out. It's like being a passenger with an annoying driver...in my own car.

Primarily its lane change choices bother me, even on the least aggressive profile. Honestly, all want is regular auto pilot without the +5 speed cap."
"I am critical on Tesla when I have to.

FSD is great! Love it."
"For me, the stress of knowing the car could do anything, at any time, and I had to be ready for it, made using FSD too stressful. This was especially true after it drove me off the road on a straight, deserted stretch of two lane highway. I stopped it from whatever it was trying to do, but WTF. That was it for me."
"It depends mostly on your expectations. If you think it‚Äôs unusable unless you don‚Äôt have to pay attention you won‚Äôt like it. If you expect it to drive like you would drive - being in ‚Äòthe right lane‚Äô, acceleration preferences, etc., it will also be annoying. Then there‚Äôs the willingness to piss people off around you. This is how the ‚Äòinfluencers‚Äô get so many ‚Äòno intervention‚Äô drives. It‚Äôs pretty rare it does something so dumb you HAVE to take over. I mostly take over for embarrassment of being in the way or knowing what kind of shitshow traffic is coming up so I get in ‚Äòthe right lane‚Äô. I enjoy watching it improve over time and perfectly willing to pay attention for now. If that‚Äôs not your thing wait until it‚Äôs at a stage where you will get enjoyment."
Its the only reason I get to work safely
"I wouldn‚Äôt pay $99 a month, because I don‚Äôt drive enough to justify it. But it‚Äôs very impressive as is and will only get better. Does it do silly stuff sometimes? Of course. But once you learn them, you can anticipate them. There is an intersection by me that it always messes up, I just turn it off when I am at the traffic light, make across and turn it on again. People who are complaining/hating are the ones that are pressing imaginary brakes when their friend is driving, they have issues with how someone else drives regardless of FSD or human."
Why is it 8k? It offered it to me for $100/month
I love mine. I am in a rural area and it works very well for my daily driving. When I venture into larger cities it still does great on highways and multiple lane situations. It hasn't gotten the hang of roundabouts just yet though.
I only intervene when I‚Äôm impatient. It otherwise does everything I want it to.
"I started the trial thinking there is no way I'd pay $8000 for it, and couldn't see myself spending more than $500.




Now I'm on day 29.¬† If it dropped to $2000 ish and lived with the owner instead of the car I would buy it tomorrow.




When we do summer road trips like we have the past few years I will happily do $99 a month for August/September every year."
"
Even though I had the computer upgraded on my 2017 Model S, mine still won‚Äôt do turns. 

Mine even gets confused on some roundabouts.

It scares my wife when it does that. 

For me, it‚Äôs like being a passenger when a 15 year old is learning to drive after having their eyes dilated.

At least Tesla is paying us to be the test subjects."
Mixed use here between highway and some suburban roadways. It absolutely attempted to kill me no fewer than a dozen times during my trial. I want the tech to work but it isn't there and would never let my child drive this car with FSD in the current state.
It's good when it's good and bad when it's bad.
After my FSD trial my regular AP felt so clumsy for my commute that I decided to subscribe to it. I don‚Äôt care for how it handles city streets but when it comes to freeway maneuvers alone it‚Äôs much ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù. It‚Äôs worth every penny for my daily 60 mile commute.
It‚Äôs really good and has made commuting easier. It doesn‚Äôt get you all the way there and you‚Äôve got to be attentive but it‚Äôs great for breaks during drives and for stop and go traffic
"Oh I love it. At the same I sometimes hate it because it frkn drives so fast and stops every late. Even when taking sharp turns on freeways, it will do it very very late."
No. Phantom braking is a consistent problem and it lane changes too much no matter what settings you put and also makes the dumbest lane changes.
"If FSD stayed with the user‚Äôs account and not with the car, I‚Äôd 100% buy it."
"You‚Äôll find more critics of it on here, because the people happy with it aren‚Äôt complaining. I love it and I fully purchased it when I bought the car last month. 

No regrets at all. Not even in the slightest.

I might even post a video of my car driving. I‚Äôll go from the stop sign at the end of my street to the Home Depot in the next town over. 

Roundabouts, active construction zones, multiple lane changes, highway driving, heavy traffic, and it‚Äôll pull itself into the parking lot so far that all I do is disable the FSD and hit the auto park."
98% of my driving is done on it
Decent but not $8k decent
Its worth $99 a month for sure.  I wouldn‚Äôt pay for it up front though.
"VERSI√ìN 12 is very good. It‚Äôs not perfect, it‚Äôs verrrry good.  We are definitely getting there.  Version 11 is less good, I think some people still have v11 out there who are taking shit about it because it still does some embarrassing things."
I signed up for $99 a month after the free trial. FSD does 99% of my driving. Last night leaving downtown Miami with the traffic it handled everything perfectly. I'm glad I cancelled all my streaming services and signed up for FSD since it actually makes a difference to my quality of life. Reduced stress and road rage will add years to my life
I don't have FSD but I find myself using the advanced autopilot (automated highway driving) more and more.  It has been getting better and better along with FSD.  Makes me feel that FSD might be worth the cost if I have a day I need to drive more again.
"I think it depends on your environment and what you drive the most. I just did an NJ to NC and then back drive. Daytime, it‚Äôs amazing at navigating route 95 and alleviating the monotony of driving. At night time when I hit NJ on my way back‚Ä¶it wouldn‚Äôt stay on because it was blinded constantly.  I even pulled into rest stops to park so fsd would reset and I could turn it on again. it didn‚Äôt stayed on for long and then a car behind me would blind the cameras. 

On NC country roads it would go too fast to handle a corner and go over the yellow line. I don‚Äôt know if I would trust it on country roads with cars pulling out suddenly or uncommon situations. 

On the other hand, I night drove the city streets of Atlantic City and it was perfect at navigating pedestrians,  parallel parked cars, all the stop lights and turns. 

So I‚Äôm going to stick with it during the busy summer driving season and see"
I like the auto park feature.
"I live in the UK and just did London to Edinburgh. Around 450 miles. Took almost 10-11 hrs for a 7 hrs if an ICE car. But the journey was tireless. Supervised FSD was superb. I didn‚Äôt have to be too focused. Just keep aware of the surroundings and it did a nice job. I‚Äôm waiting for my HW upgrade to 3.0 and it would make it even better. 

The charging on the way was pain though and ate a lot of time."
"I think expectations can be very high, and when they are then the user has a negative experience. 

It‚Äôs not self driving yet but can play a role as an extra set of eyes for the driver who is in control. 

The $8k price is basically a bet on if you believe Tesla will solve self driving or at least dramatically improve before you buy another car."
"I love it and it‚Äôs worth $99/month for me. Use it for 90%+ of my driving. I do wish the freeway was a bit better, I hate how it wants to change out of the carpool lane all the time (i know freeway is still FSD 11)"
I‚Äôm in a lowish traffic area and it works very well. I tend to disable it in congested city conditions.
"i'd guess 75% of those on reddit who are hating on it dont own it, and the other 20% just hate Elon for his politics.  5% are those who paid 12k+"
V12.3 is very good. It is super helpful with my daily commute. Also a must-have for road trips.
"price went from 10k -> 12k -> 15k then back down to 8k

ill wait until all cars have this feature and can normalize a price"
"Just got the updated version a few days ago, it might be the best update so far. I use it everyday now, but night driving kind of sucks because FSD experience can be degraded due to not enough lighting available."
"I‚Äôve had FSD in our Model 3 since Sept 2018, 128k miles so far. My usual commute into town is ballpark 20 miles each way, and I have yet to have a truly intervention free drive. I‚Äôve had one or two where the only intervention I did was tap the accelerator pedal to get it to stop hesitating on a turn, but on most drives there‚Äôs some little weird thing I disengage for. Safety related disengages have definitely gotten noticeably less frequent over the years."
"It‚Äôs basically a lot better than many critics give it credit for‚Äîthere has been dramatic progress since I got it in 2020. But it‚Äôs also *terrifying* when it doesn‚Äôt work, which is anywhere from 5-10% of the time in my experience. That may sound like not much but it‚Äôs very, very far from being able to actually trust it to do what it says, ie actual self-driving. I never let it go unsupervised, but it‚Äôs a godsend in standstill traffic and long trips, taking a large measure of stress off. 

I only paid $7k for it so I feel like I got my money‚Äôs worth but at $14k, it is absolutely not worth it. It‚Äôs also nowhere near ready for anyone not prepared to always take charge, which to be fair is how it‚Äôs clearly presented. But when it works, it really works. It will be pretty great down the road."
"Anyone that thinks it‚Äôs unusable might not have given the latest version a chance. At least on local. 

I used to think it sucked based on the loaners that had it. But I got the latest trial which ended yesterday and wow. It is amazing. It literally did all my local driving for a month.  

One time there was construction and the light was out. On the way out it treated as a stop sign. On the way back it followed the commands of a person directing traffic. 

Yesterday I noticed in traffic it left the intersection clear of there is too many cars. 

I‚Äôm still not paying 100 a month for it but I‚Äôm going to miss it"
"It wasn‚Äôt very good before I got the update.i had to intervene a lot. But I have to say it‚Äôs actually incredible after the update, it actually drives itself"
"It depends on what version. It gets better, then it gets worse, then it gets better, then it gets worse.

They will figure it out, but it‚Äôs going to be years, not months."
"I think it‚Äôs fantastic. Ready to flip the switch, not yet. Iron out a few more edge cases and then slowly dip your toe in the water. I think a lot of what pale don‚Äôt like about FSD is that it‚Äôs not always smooth or doesn‚Äôt drive like them, which feels strange in the driver‚Äôs seat. But when you‚Äôre the passenger it‚Äôll feel quite nice."
When I first got it +\- 1 year ago it was a bit scary. But I kept testing after every large version number release and now I use it daily with rare intervention.
You're right OP. FSD is very good. But not $8k good!
"It's definitely decent.  Not worth the full price to me.  Honestly the randomness of other drivers is what holds it back.  Like people speeding up to not let you merge into an exit lane, etc."
I thought it was impressive but hampered by the utter unpredictability of people driving aggressively on the roads and folks being general assholes to Teslas just to mess with them. If it were $50/month I‚Äôd subscribe.
There is recent news of a crash involving law enforcement and Tesla FSD. It was bound to happen given how unsafe it was when I tested it during the free trial period that they gave to everyone on April 2024. It confirmed my decision to not purchase it.
"It's more than decent. It's a revolution. The car drives itself almost anywhere. We need to stop nitpicking and admit that it's probably the most life changing technology since the smartphone. It's worth $99/mo, and it will do nothing but improve over time. A fully intervention free drive is rare, but we've come so far and now we're in the last mile."
"I pay the $99 when I‚Äôm going on long commutes or trips. Well worth it. For everyday, the regular autopilot is great. It keeps me in the center of my lane, slows down and speeds up‚Ä¶perfect. 

I rented a Ford Edge, Titanium Model a couple weeks ago and it has a ‚Äúself drive‚Äù feature, claiming to be the best of its kind‚Ä¶wow, it kinda sucked. It worked by weaving from side to side in the lane and it kinda tapped you back towards the center when you drifted. Nothing like the Tesla."
I have been using FSD for four years. I love it. I use it all the time.  Just like anything there is a learning curve and you should always use it responsibly.
"It works for the most part in un-challenging situations, but I never feel especially safe with it. I have subscribed to it a couple of times before the monthlong trial, and then had it during the trial. It has done something that unnerved me every time I‚Äôve had it, so I have always felt like I needed to be hyper aware when it was driving. When I‚Äôm 100% driving, or even using autopilot on a highway for the most part, I don‚Äôt.

For example, when we had the free month a few weeks ago, I was on a drive between Houston and Austin in my 21 Model Y. Nice four-lane road, everything well-marked, the car showing that it completely understood the road based on the display. I was in the left lane a lot, and multiple times at 75mph, the car would out of the blue try to take one of those short cut outs on the left for taking a side road or turning around to go the other way. Because the car was navigating straight, it made no sense that it would even try to take a left turn at over 70mph. If I hadn‚Äôt already been a little on edge and holding the steering wheel to override it, I would have been in the median at high speed. It wouldn‚Äôt have been trying to turn left or around, it was just trying to steer me into the middle ditch.

Around town and in the neighborhood, it gets waaaaay too close to street-parked cars and curbs on the right as well.

I can respect all the work they‚Äôve done with this, and the dedication to getting it right, but if it acts this weird in easy situations, we‚Äôre a very long way from robo-taxis. I think it‚Äôs shocking they‚Äôre still able to charge so much for something that really doesn‚Äôt deliver on its promise."
It‚Äôs decent for what it is. Had they marketed as ‚Äúadvanced driver assist‚Äù it wouldn‚Äôt be so contentious.
"It was awful, but really good for me since the last update.  I haven‚Äôt used it much at night or in bad weather (light rain was fine), but it is fine for just driving around town durning the day."
It has been fantastic for me. I got my Tesla used and it came with EAP. I will definitely be dropping the $2k for FSD.
FSD is great.  I use it daily.
"Don‚Äôt pay $8k, do the $99 a month. Easy math, and you can cancel any time and not be out $8k"
In heavy city traffic‚Ä¶. Good luck
Yes it‚Äôs good
"I use it daily, love it."
"It‚Äôs fantastic. For me, it seems to do better in environments with heavy traffic. But overall it‚Äôs just bonkers how well the city stack handles driving. V12 is a completely difference experience compared to earlier versions.

The highway stack is still janky, though. Can‚Äôt wait till that goes E2E."
I agree. I use FSD most of the time I use my car. It‚Äôs great! The amount of times I‚Äôve had to take over has been minimal and I can usually tell ahead of time that the conditions might be hard for the car to figure out. Worth every penny at $8k if you ask me.
"I've done the trial on mine and we have it active on my wife's for a couple more weeks. Quite a few FSD rides, day and night. I would absolutely plunk down the 8k if FSD stayed with me. I will never use it enough to warrant a regular subscription and I don't think it is worth the 8k for a car I'll probably replace in 3-4 years. 

On one hand I understand Tesla's angle, on the other I think they need to look at this more as getting us invested in their ecosystem. If someone is 8k deep on FSD they're going to be more likely to make Tesla their next car again. The day they change the policy on this I will buy it. In the mean time I am content with Autopilot which is a system I will and do use regularly to ease fatigue on the highway. 

I will note I'm super impressed with it as well, our first experience with this sort of system was a 23 Rogue and while Nissan's ProPilot was 90% there Tesla's Autopilot is above and beyond better. Its much smoother speeding up and slowing down, it doesn't pingpong in the lines like ProPilot and I'm not afraid for my life passing a truck like with ProPilot which would hug the right line when doing so. ProPilot does have auto reengagement after a lane change though you can get that feature with Autopilot thanks to the s3xy buttons/knob/commander(a wonderful product)."
"For the cost FSD is really only worth it if you do a lot of road trips, it‚Äôs kind of unrealistic to use it on your daily commute, I found myself only using it when doing interstate or highway driving out of town"
Long trips on highways ap/fsd is great. But around town It actually increases my stress level having to supervise it. While it's getting better it needs to become mostly unsupervised for me to trust it
"FSD is amazing. Reddit is just gonna hate.

I live in southern California and it handles my morning/evening major rush hour commutes so easily.  The stress it takes away from me is so much worth it.  I still do pay attention, but in a much different way than when driving myself.  I am more relaxed and just supervising the car while it does everything.  Just need to let the car do its thing.

I will add though, that I wouldn't pay $8k for FSD.  I bought my used MY which already had EAP.  So the $2k was easy to justify, and I do feel like it's the perfect price for something like this.  Hopefully they lower it again soon."
"I have a 2023 M3P,  I pay the 99/month for some months. And then I turn it off for others. Depends if I‚Äôm planning on any road trips. It‚Äôs nice for that. It does a decent enough job but I find myself taking over here and there. So definitely need to pay attention. 

I would buy it in full if the feature stayed with my user instead of the car. 

But I trade and get a new car every 3 to 4 years so with how it stays with the car it‚Äôs like throwing money away."
"I have a 2024 myp and I use FSD 85-90% of the time, the other 10-15% I‚Äôm using the full 0-60 and performance lol! I absolutely love FSD and look forward to each iteration getting better and better. 
That being said, I would never buy it at the full price when the subscription is available, that math just doesn‚Äôt work out."
Yes it‚Äôs good! In so cal at least
"Ive been unimpressed with it.  Feels like I'm being driven by a spastic teenager that just got their license.

Random lane changes for seemingly no reason and to limit this I need to change the setting Everytime,  likes to drive into other cars blind spot while they are merging, doesn't anticipate gaps when I'm entering highway,  slams brakes if a light turns yellow right before entering intersection, hits every pot hole, if it drives in a shopping center with the angled pedestrian lines in front of the store my Tesla will freakout and start jerking the car back and forth while it suddenly tries to follow the pedestrian lines.

I do like it for longer road trips and would pay something for it but not what they are asking"
Use it everyday. Game changer.
It‚Äôs more than decent lol. It‚Äôs mind-blowing. Mind-blowing doesn‚Äôt mean perfect - it means it‚Äôs extremely impressive and far beyond what the vast majority of people think is currently possible.
"Its is good on a highway or interstate. But there is so much construction in my area, it is unsafe on my local streets. Biggest issue if you ask me is the lack of consistency in the road markings and lane sizes. Maybe if I ever live in a town that is done."
FSD is awesome.  Reddit is not real life. Ignore haters
"Yes and no. Hard to keep track of because the behavior changes a lot between updates. Mostly not amazing but it works for me most of the time so I like it.

I wish I could have preferences like ""I only want to do 17mph on this street"" or not to hug a certain side of the road where there's always a pot hole"
"Is the FSD bad? Nope, is not bad at all. But is it essential? Nope. Will I buy it. Nope. 

I'm not a rich man where I have a spare $100 every month or $8000 lying around to waste on a toy. And I like driving, that's why I buy a fast EV."
It is getting there I have seen improvements after every patch update. I still see it hesitates and does emergency brake at orange becoming red lights
It‚Äôs all I use lately!!! God send in heavy traffic
Just finished trial today.  I'd pay $1k for it.
"I wish there was a 3 months price or a yearly subscription. My trial just ended and I drove 99% on it. Just not justifiable for me though, I work remote. Maybe I will for road trips."
Nah. It‚Äôs bad. It successfully hits every pot hole here in SoCal. I hate it
"It's not smooth enough for me, but I might consider renting it for a week if I had to make a trip for a month no.  Or renting it by the day."
Mines seems to always have weird problems. It kinda drives like an old lady but it still works for what it is
It‚Äôs actually pretty darn good.
I can't trust the adaptive cruise control how could i ever even attempt full self driving
That's a little tough to answer right now. I'd say it probably depends on the places you plan to drive. I've found FSD invaluable on interstate road trips to help me not miss the right exits and also in the South in general where local roads are nice but destinations can be far apart. It works great in my Queens New York driving most days. I usually only disengage to avoid potholes but there's still simple stuff that might seem annoying like stopping too soon at stop signs and then creeping up instead of just stopping where most people would stop. Overall it's great and it's getting genuienly better every update.
Done something like 80% of my driving for the last year+. It is absolutely amazing.
It was a 2k upgrade on my car that came with EAP (used). I like it but I‚Äôd never consider paying 8k for it.
"price is not going down its gonna go up, I'm buying as soon as he says he's raising it"
"I'd only heard bad things before I got my tesla. Hell I only heard bad things about teslas in general. Anyway, I love FSD. I pay the $100/month since it makes more sense than 8k. I'll probably get a new car every 4 years, so the numbers are better. I have about a 35 minute commute. It does well on that. Hell I had it take me on a 500 mile road trip and rarely had to intervene. It's better than people think. That being said, it still does dumb stuff. Mine LOVES to turn into the wrong lane if there isn't a car in the second turn lane."
We have a vision only and USS+vision Y and they are both great at FSD.
"Baaaah how we in EU also want a free trial or atleast the 99$\month to try it out. Sigh.

sorry for irrelevant post but i really want to try it. But imagine its 8000$ for you, for me its 80.000. Ofc cant do exaclty that seeing salaray and costs of living. But its for sure around 12-15.000$ in comparing the cost."
"I‚Äôve driven over 50k miles with FSD, and have been driving my new daily driver without it for about the last 5,000 miles. I miss it dearly and can‚Äôt wait for it to be available soon."
"Idk, when I tried the trial I determined that I wouldn‚Äôt use it if it was free. By far the worst experience I ever had.

Missing exits, slamming on brakes last minute, phantom braking, using my brakes in general (if I can drive solely on regen braking, why can‚Äôt FSD?), slow driving, not avoiding potholes, sitting at stop signs for upwards of 20 seconds, lane changing less than 0.1mi from where I need to turn, etc. I‚Äôd rather just drive and use AP on highways."
"I like it and mine actually handles roundabouts well compared to what others have said. One thing that irritates me is that it waits to get into a turning lane sometimes to the point where it‚Äôll wait then merge across a solid white line (it‚Äôs on assertive too). Due to this, it‚Äôs missed a few turns because it waited too long. Other than that, it does very very well even going through the mountains around hairpin turns which terrified me at first."
No it's not lol oddly it depends on your area mine makes mistakes every drive
I agree it has gotten good. The one thing that bothers me is that with FSD I can tell the brakes are being applied when slowing down. I am used to one pedal driving and never using the brakes.
Fsd beta is a lot better than it was even 6 months ago.
"i think it really depends where you live and how the roads are setup. 

In Tucson, I use it everyday......"
"When I subscribed about 2 months ago, I was put on FSD 11.3.1 I believe. It was jittery, reluctant, and demonstrated uncertainty in areas that are typically regular things to do when driving. It kept on wanting to blast through metal gates that were on sensors that would open when you got close enough. If I had to keep using that version, I would have canceled it. 

About a month ago, I finally got 12.3.6 and that was a complete game changer. It‚Äôs really, really good. I‚Äôve gotten used to the gaps when I know I have to intervene. That‚Äôs less than 1% of the overall drives. The rest of the time, it‚Äôs much more relaxing to drive."
I own it. Wouldn‚Äôt buy it again. Won‚Äôt be truly self-driving for at least 5-10 years and won‚Äôt work on most Teslas on the road today IMO
"I can‚Äôt drive any of the FSD platforms I‚Äôve tried. Have it on my MY, even if it worked 100% of the time it‚Äôs just super slow for safety and a bit annoying. So meh."
"They need to pay us as a tester, not the other way around."
"I've tried older models with more senors and they drive amazing, very stable. I have november 2023model y and autopilot accelerates too hard and brakes Soo late and hesitates and jerks too much to the point I don't feel safe using it"
It‚Äôs very human like and I love FSD.
Bottom line - FSD (interventions and all) + me is a safer vehicle than me alone. Saved me from an accident.
Must be your area.  My trial kept slamming on brakes trying to turn into driveways 1500ft before planned turns.  EAP is still tops.
"The best part about FSD is the FSD visualizations. For me, it‚Äôs about the only good part."
"Hypothetically, if I drove a route then a day later had FSD drive it and compared the two there would be small differences. I think people get caught up in those differences.

That being said, it feels like a skeleton that needs a few things worked out before it can be confused for an actual human.

Been a user for 4 years and I can say it has come a long way though!"
"I watch all those FSD videos on YouTube more than I should. And all I gotta say is that it‚Äôs gotten really really good. I almost don‚Äôt want to say some of the things it doesn‚Äôt do well because it‚Äôll overshadow how great it is and how far it‚Äôs come in the past year. 

I drove one a couple weeks ago. Took it on the interstate in semi-stop and go traffic. Off the interstate to deal with traffic lights, stop signs, heavily trafficked intersections, and traffic circles. And back on the interstate.

My biggest complaint is that it was very jerky. It‚Äôs literally the last thing that‚Äôs stopping me from buying a Tesla. I‚Äôve tried asking the sales guy if this was common and got a canned answer. If i was in the back for more than a half hour I probably woulda puked. That‚Äôs how bad it was

Can anybody confirm if FSD is notoriously ‚Äújerky‚Äù when accelerating and decelerating? If it matters it was a brand new model Y."
It is quite good and improving constantly.  Not yet fully autonomous though.
"Definitely decent !

I'm in the trial and pretty impressed. Is it perfect? Nope! Have most drivers made as many mistakes as it does? Probably. 

I'm not paying $8k and not regularly going to pay $100 a month. But for $50 a month ? Hmmm...."
"I'm not sure how FSD could be considered decent in the current market, neat as it was when it launched.

It costs 8k or 100/mo for a camera-only (as I understand it) system that does work, but can be iffier than similar systems presumably due to the lack of radar.

Super Cruise on Chevy/GMC vehicles is a $2200 option that uses cameras plus other sensors and is free for the first three years, then 25/mo thereafter.

An FSD subscription is more expensive than SC by the time you hit 2 years of ownership, and it would take almost 23 years for the cost of SC to catch up to the 8k option.

Maybe I'm missing something?"
My trial ended too. Now I miss fsd rofl. I loved the full screen. Only thing I didn't like is the lane changes. It would change for no reason sometimes.
Good enough for the burbs
Nope
It's one of the most impressive technologies I've ever witnessed.
"FSD's reliability varies based on how many Teslas are in your area.

If you're the only Tesla, then odds are it will not work as well as you'd like.

If there's a lot of Teslas, then it should be better.

It also depends on how much you use it.  If you turn it on and say ""Oof, this is shit"" and turn it right back off, it's never going to log your problem areas, and you'll never see improvements

Some of the improvements do take time to be seen though."
"FSD is not autonomous driving. One has to continue monitoring it and be prepared to intervene if needed.  I do long road trips and find FSD gives me a much more relaxing drive and I get to my destination with much less fatigue and  stress.  When I'm driving, I'm pretty focused on the lane in front of me and microsteering at all times. I get eye strain after a few hours and my body is tensed. With FSD, I focus less on steering and looking out for situations coming up where I might have to intervene such as weird lane merges and exits, emergency vehicles on the side of the road, construction,  etc. I actually am now able tp look at the scenery and interesting sights that I'm passing. 
In town, i like that in not having to worry as much about  preparing for and navigating every turn in advance, suddenly crossing pedestrians, sudden traffic stops, etc. It isn't perfect but it does reduce the mental lag. 
My night vision and vison in the rain are not great and getting worse as I age.  I trust the car's cameras more than my own eyes in those situations to protect myself and others."
I feel like people who swear by FSD have to be terrible drivers. I‚Äôve never felt comfortable with it on city streets but feel like it‚Äôs whatever for the highway. Not for me.
No.
"It's alright, but it really should be included with the car. I'm not paying that much to alpha test a product that is still very far away from FSD."
I just finished my free trial. Good god was it bad for me. Nope it's got a long way to go.
It depends on the car you have. Older cars with worse hardware packages are significantly worse. Newer cars with HW4 are great with it.
No. Next question.

"I want to like it, I really do. But in the span of an hour it:
- Went straight across an intersection from the left turn lane
- Tried to blow a red light because the left arrow turned green (I was going straight)
- Lost its ever-loving mind on an off ramp because of some cones on the side of the road
- Several instances of phantom braking on the freeway

That was enough for me. Even for free, it‚Äôs just not good enough. It feels like riding with a 16-year-old that *technically* knows how to drive, but you have to be eagle-eyed because they‚Äôre liable to screw up any second. I like driving anyway; autopilot is all I want. If it could be smoother and reduce the phantom breaking I‚Äôd love it."
"I absolutely love FSD (even though I've got the old HW3 on my 2107 MX), but the entire 12 stack has been a major regression in functionality for me. 

With the last 11 series build, I was able to just baby sit the entire drive from Portland, OR to Eureka, CA, only needing to take over to pull into and out of supercharger stations. 

With 12, it crosses double yellow on blind corners, hard ghost brakes for green lights, and I can't for the life of me get it to hold speed at my set speed - I'm constantly having to push it back up to the set speed, regardless of whether the set speed is below (e.g, school zones), at (e.g., other surface streets), or above (e.g., freeways so I don't get run over üòâ) the posted speed limit. I still use it almost every time I get into the car, but the ghost braking and crossing double yellow lines make it a solo use feature, not a ""when I've got passengers"" feature. üòí"
"It's great when it's great, but it does some dumb shit."
"For every one person praising FSD there‚Äôs 5 people complaining. My personal experiences have been neutral, but my conclusion is that $100 a month is ludicrous for what‚Äôs really a glorified beta test."
Nope
It‚Äôs outstanding.  I just did a 300 mile road trip and only needed to deactivate it when I was parking and charging.
It‚Äôs worse than it was with the last free trial.
12.5.6.3 actually slows down using regen. This is saving my brake pads compared to previous versions
"Driving down the highway in daylight isn't where the problems are.  I love FSD but your impression here is way rosier than reality.  You might be lucky and not have anything that throws it off, but a lot of stuff that shouldn't does.

Any time it's driving local roads it's far less efficient than I am as well."
"My 2024 Model S still drives on non-highways like a 16 year old. 

It's not great. It's ""ok""."
I had some minor issues with FSD but mostly has been amazing. Especially since my wife has epilepsy so it gives us peace of mind if she were to have a seizure while driving
"I drive an 'old' 2021 Model Y and I just took the plunge and bought it outright i love it so much..   with no-nag on [12.5.4.2](http://12.5.4.2) \- the experience is incredible.   I just tell myself its like being on a ride at disney, I swear.  It'll get your heart rate going from time to time and ofcourse you have to disegage sometimes - but for the \*most\* part - it's amazingly hands free now..."
"It's alright but I don't like it in the city. Highways are good but that's fulfilled by Autopilot already.

50-60¬∞F is also the most efficient temperature for Teslas I believe."
"Agree! I have been heavily using FSD for the past 2.5 years, and probably 40k miles on FSD. Been through many major versions. And now it's the sweet point that I can have zero intervention for my daily 2 hours drive with highway and locals (home, school and office)."
I got FSD for a trip thru Orange County right now but is having a hard time navigating compared to the routes locals tell me to take‚Ä¶. same for the sf bay bridge.   Especially during HOV access times and lanes.   Otherwise it‚Äôs very good
Just got back from a 750 mile round trip and its awesome. All I did was listen to History That Doesn‚Äôt Suck the whole time.
[12.5.6.3](http://12.5.6.3) has some serious regressions on city streets. It tends to run red lights and make wrong lane changes (going into the leftmost lane on a right turn).
"I think it is much much better than before. Much smoother and I feel it reacts better. I still pay close attention and it‚Äôs not perfect, but I am able to drive less stressed out during my commutes and in town. I like the progress Tesla has made."
[removed]
is this HW3 or 4? What version are you running?
How do you get this detailed graph?
Love it. Use it every day. 12.5.6.3 is really good so far. Fixed a few glaring issues and it feels great merging finally. No fantom breaking so far.
"I loved, loved, loved v12.5.4. Loved it. It was the first version with which I completely confident in sitting back, hands-off and letting the car take me A to B. I was raving about it to anyone who would listen.

Now I‚Äôm on 12.5.4.2 and am absolutely astonished at how terrible it is. Like literal disbelief. I cannot understand how it regressed so significantly.
I didn‚Äôt think much of 12.3.6 but I think 12.5.4.2 might be worse. If not, it‚Äôs close. 

It hits the brakes at every intersection, even if the light is green, absolutely freaks out when making right turns, pausing mid-turn and jerking the wheel back and forth, turns wide into the wrong lane, and maybe most confusingly, defies the programmed navigation telling it to continue straight and follows cars making turns in front of me"
I got to use this trial for about 20 minutes before I had 3 phantom braking incidents. My girlfriend refused to ride in the car if I didn‚Äôt switch it back to autopilot.
FSD is completely night and day different depending on the model of vehicle you have. 2016 model X here. I guarantee a 2024 FSD Tesla does a whole lot better than ours haha.
How did you come up with 116% accuracy?
What‚Äôs he point until you can sit in the back while it drives?
It‚Äôs literally ‚Äúwhether you match the patters it has and you like it or don‚Äôt and you dislike it‚Äù
"I just went and test drove a Tesla for the first time yesterday. 30 minute test drive so I drove about 15 minutes away from the Tesla center and then had FSD drive me back. Didn't need to touch the steering wheel until it pulled me into the parking lot. Overall, it was great except it didn't seem to want to go the speed limit no matter how high I set the max speed."
"OP, et al - opinions on Tessie vs Teslafi vs others?"
I have a 2022 model 3 long range I had it drive 4 hours for my wife and my road trip. 218 miles covered arriving at 28% I had to take over once and it was the dumbest thing 5 seconds into our journey a no right on red. I also had to tap the accelerator because it was slowing down coming up to a green light. Over all I will say the smoothness of 12.5 is really nice. I felt confident in it getting to our hotel In LA VS 12.3 which was a lot worse in city driving. The auto setting felt natural in LA but my small town it drives too slow.
"It‚Äôs absolutely fantastic if you use it situationally. ¬†I love it for traffic. When I‚Äôm stuck behind cars and can‚Äôt have fun I engage FSD. On any 20 minute drive I engage and disengage 4 or 5 times

I won‚Äôt use it for blind lefts, uncomfortable merging, etc.¬†

Lower expectations and it‚Äôs the most amazing feature in the history of cars.¬†"
"I love the most recent update 12.5.6.3. The ‚Äòhurry‚Äô mode drive was so natural I couldn‚Äôt believe it! I drove 50 kms last night on highway 401 (Toronto) end to end and didn‚Äôt have to intervene even once. I was pretty nervous how close it got to the car in front of me but managed so well and lane changes were on point to how I‚Äôd drive when I‚Äôm in a hurry. Exits were smooth and now awkward swerves on forks. This is the first time I felt, damn I wish I could afford FSD. Model Y RWD."
"Has an issue with blinking red lights‚Ä¶.  Guess that one isn‚Äôt programmed in yet.  Had to take control.  

Lots of, sometimes hard, braking for road side oddities.  

Green light at busy intersection brain fart, had to take control.

Other than that‚Ä¶ no accidents."
"I think it‚Äôs trash. And for me, it‚Äôs not much better than I think. To those who think it‚Äôs good, I always assume you must be a terrible driver."
" What do you mean ‚Äútrain it‚Äù


It does not learn from your actions, FYI"
12.5 on HW3 is way worse than 12.3.6 was
"I use to always wonder why do so many Tesla drivers drive so bad!?!?!?! Then, one day I rode with a co-worker in his M3 using FSD. He didn‚Äôt even bat an eye or consider all the drivers around him as the car navigated these crazy Atlanta roads like a freaking 15 yr old with a fresh learners permit!ü§Ø. All he cared about was having access to this cool technology ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Yeah, it‚Äôs not for me."
No it‚Äôs not
" Nope, it‚Äôs caca and a driving liability."
some dude in mumbai is going to be playing gran turismo in your whip
"I don‚Äôt get it, a new beta program?"
I‚Äôm assuming this is HW4 only
"Wait, if I do this will they be able to see me having a wank on the cabin camera?"
What does it mean? We have been using FSD for years.
Have been using FSD for my 2 hours commute daily. Flawless.
Wow. So it‚Äôs just FSD supervised but beta again?
"Still fail to see why FSD isn‚Äôt either free or a fraction of the cost given we are paying for the luxury of testing software for them. That said, FSD is pretty dang cool when it works well."
Aren‚Äôt we already in beta?
Maybe this is to be on the same release as Tesla employees? I can‚Äôt imagine the data being much better than what‚Äôs submitted already by consenting to sharing data so maybe they want more testing so they don‚Äôt end up with issues like lane drift again? Also been a quite month overall for fsd and with the June launch for robotaxi coming up they‚Äôve gotta start making huge steps as fsd is now where near ready for no steering wheel usage yet.
I got in. Had to restart the app
I'm guessing part of the deal is you have to allow your Tesla to eat up all of your home data allotment with video uploads?
"I opted into this. What should I expect from it?

RIP
So this is Gamma‚Ä¶
I was disappointed thinking this was unsupervised for a brief second. Basically the opportunity to get the update a bit earlier in exchange for sharing all of the data. I personally share everything except the internal camera.
"Oh! another FSD beta, but this time it REALLY works. No, actually truly really. 
Hey did I ever tell you about this amazing bridge I have for sale?"
"To be clear, they launched it not because it‚Äôs ready, but because they‚Äôve dismantled the agency that would tear them apart when people start dying to it."
Wow!!
Early access users are beta testers of sorts.  I Was part of the program a number of years ago when it was more casual
It should be beta cube by now
Gotta prop up the stock somehow.
Looks like the app to sign in?
Is the same FSD that doesn't use lidar and drove through a painting of a road in independent tests?
I was in the Early Access and a day one FSD 10.2 Beta tester. Wonder if I'm auto enrolled or still enrolled? So far no pop up in the App.
what does FSD even mean? kinda shocked that you don't need to be exposed to the acronym's definition in order to turn on the config
Didn't see this on my 2025 bingo card!
The invite isn‚Äôt appearing for me.  Maybe all the slots are full.
My FSD 13.2.8 is already great and I was already first 100 FSD betas originally. Cool popup though.
"What was old is new again.  I did not get an invite, boo."
Can someone explain to me what has changed?
"Is this only for those who already have FSD, or will it be offered for free?"
"Elons doing his bit for Darwinism, are you doing yours?"
And I didn‚Äôt get an invite :(
Anything to save his company
"How long until there is an executive order saying you cannot sue a company over ""self-driving"" accidents."
Does it kill it's occupants faster or something? What are the features?
"So this is beta beta? 

We kindly ask you to sign this waver stating that we are not responsible for your death in case this beta beta software fails and you are killed in a ball of fire."
How‚Äôs this different from what‚Äôs already out there?
FSD (supervised) - LOOOOOL
Id rather not kill myself
This gives free FSD forever or just for a brief amount of time?
Can‚Äôt wait to see the crash videos on Reddit
"Keep your beta test off my highways.

I just want to get to work. I don't want to DIE dodging your questionable 'AI'."
The clown show continues
"Isnt FSD already a beta program where if you're lucky, it can go 100 miles without trying to kill you and your family?"
"Nazi cars, built by and for nazis! ‚Äã"

"For those who don't want to watch the whole video, MY with HW3 would want to hit the wall.  Cyber truck with HW4 (and I believe a bumper camera) stopped way before the wall."
Finally figured out what's causing all those FSD crashes we've been hearing about! Walls painted like roads are popping up everywhere!
Was there a trucker parked behind his wall? What was the plan if he blew through it? Just crash?
"The wall depicts a clear sunny day, which was not the case when testing the CT. Since the same weather/sun effects didn't match, the wall stuck out like a sore thumb. Had the wall mirrored the same conditions like it did when they were testing the model Y, then we might have seen different results."
So what does this all prove/mean? That LiDar is better than Autopilot and FSD+HW3 but on par with FSD+HW4?
"So basically if you have a Tesla that has HW4 (2023 or later models), then FSD sees the wall."
"Did no one actually watch the video?  It stopped fine with FSD hw4, with very old FSD 3 it didn‚Äôt stop.  Still another bad test with hw3.  But it shows it STOPS fine if you actually have a recent FSD"
"The original test/video is stupid, IMO, but are we going to ignore the fact that in this video the car is casting a shadow on the wall and breaks as soon as the shadow shows up? Are we also going to ignore the fact that that the wall for the CT was sticking out very differently due to not having the same lighting conditions?"
"I still don‚Äôt get how this test was some big gotcha, there ares too many road looking walls in the middle of the street where I live.  I get the premise but test it more realistically"
The only way to make it a real comparison would be to test both vehicles as close to the same time and under the same conditions as possible.  Otherwise it's not a fair comparison and should be treated as completely different data points.
"Mark Rober didn't use FSD though, he used AutoPilot at most. And I still can't tell if he disengaged it or it's a failsafe so the car disengaged it right before/upon impact (15:42 time-stamp in Mark Rober's video). 

Can we compare apples to apples.... Like I really want to see what the results are but people can't even do equal comparisons. 

Do a test in identical vehicles, same software updates and everything. Also, do it SEPARATELY in cruise control, autopilot, and FSD. Isn't this common sense? Can add older vs newer models as well because a model from a few years ago might have different results than last year's."
I think everyone is forgetting that HIgh Resolution Radar has not been enabled yet. That would cover a situation like this scenario. Tesla is basically pushing the cameras to the furthest capabilities then adding High Resolution Radar into the mix for the very edge cases that cameras may miss. The Radar is already present in HW4 cars just not enabled yet.
Yea but why testing an outdated car and hw? His FSD was months old. He should have done it with a model 3 highland. Since I assume that the LiDAR hardware was the latest.
This might be an unpopular opinion here but I have no issues with Rober testing using base autopilot because that version is what's on like 80% of all Teslas. Tesla needs to update the years old base autopilot to the fsd code then videos like this won't be as effective.
Great video. Tesla with FSD would have crashed too. Good luck to Tesla if they plan on suing Mark Rober.
 Rober also only used autopilot not fsd and only turned it on at the last second.  Clearly defrauding the public for click bait.  Huge case for lawsuit
"I don't actually get why Rober would test an old version of tesla autopilot vs a latest lidar and Cherry pick metrics.  Just ask yourself whether you would give up your eyes for lidar.  The answer is no.  It's like a sonar vs vision.  Dumbest comparison ever

 Rober deserves all the hate"
[removed]
It's not real life scenario.
I think the time of day probably gave the Cybertruck the advantage because of the contrast between the wall and the sky/road. I wonder if the Y/X would have stopped at the same time of day due to the lighting/color differences?
"Glad to see this, even if it's a bit flawed. 

All of the people saying FSD would absolutely stop when autopilot wouldn't were smoking crack. The cameras run on image recognition. Putting a big image up in the middle of the road is going to fool FSD every time (unless there is a lighting difference).

Now I want to see someone do the same Lidar/vision FSD test with a big mirror instead of just an image."
TL;DW - HW3 Teslas won't stop. HW4 Teslas will.
"Doesn‚Äôt make me feel better if somebody can show that it works once, most people won‚Äôt be using full self driving in that car was supposed to have safety collision avoidance, regardless.  A Toyota would‚Äôve stopped."
Yeah of course v12.4.5.1 won't stop for Coyote walls. That's just science. But [v12.5.4.2.3.1a.hydra.X.AE](http://v12.5.4.2.3.1a.hydra.X.AE) will \*totally\* stop for any and all paintings that look like a road. I can't believe they're using any version older than 12.5.2.florp for this. Amateurs.
"So if you wait until sunset, and the light no longer matches the photo on the wall, a Tesla will stop. No surprise here. Overall the first test proved the point. I guess if Tesla gives me a new computer that actually works I‚Äôd be satisfied."
"Could this be tested with a wall that does not look like the road? Many people would likely have hit that as well. 

In what real world concerning way does this imply that there is a safety issue? If you‚Äôre going to put up a wall, then put up a wall, make it look like a wall and run the test. Everyone knows that the car uses cameras."
Did he mention at any point that with the CT his blue sky wall no longer matched the sunset behind it‚Ä¶?
"I dont even understand why these tests even happen or why anyone is surprised by it.  A vision based system is looking with vision only.  If something looks the same, it's not going to know.  The system can be tricked.  Only with additional sensors could it detect it.  That's exactly why humans use camouflage because it messes with the visual sensory of the brain and we can't perceive the real object well.  Without additional sensors like sound, smell, or additional technology like thermal imaging, it won't work for everything.  This doesnt make the software garbage.  It is just a limitation that needs to be augmented.  I still agree with Teslas approach because if you can solve 95% of situations with vision only THEN apply additional sensors weighted toward the vision system, the false-positives are less likely to fight each other."
"A buddy of mine used to work as a robot vacuum engineer, and he always insisted that computer vision would eventually surpass LIDAR. I didn‚Äôt believe him at the time.

But I‚Äôve since become a convert‚Äîat least when it comes to robot vacuums.

I used to think LIDAR was superior. Over time, though, I saw its limitations: it couldn‚Äôt detect dog poop on the carpet, it would stop for something as trivial as a crumpled paper towel, and so on. Meanwhile, computer vision just kept getting better.

These days, the top-tier vacuums combine both technologies. But if you try a high-quality, vision-only model, you quickly realize that LIDAR isn‚Äôt really necessary.

I suspect the automotive industry will head in the same direction. LIDAR adds a lot to the bill of materials (e.g., something like $1000 per vehicle), and if its main purpose is to protect against implausible scenarios‚Äîlike someone painting a fake tunnel on a wall Wile E. Coyote-style‚Äîit may not be worth the cost."
"The same outcome, not worth a watch imo.¬†"
great - but we should not condone locking safety behind a paywall.
Why does he grab the wheel right before impact and you hear the audible chime of AP disengaging?
I am curious if it registers the shadow...
"This isn‚Äôt a good test, the cyber truck on its runs had a pedestrian standing close to the street and truck picked him up , that could‚Äôve been why it slowed as opposed to model y no person was near the wall or street ."
It doesn‚Äôt matter FSD or not. Any car today with autobreak should identify things much better
"Why is that video over 10 minutes long? Just show us the dang video, stop talking so much. ü§¶üèø"
you‚Äôre doing gods work
Glad FSD gets to shine but All these test and they should just show how bad TAC and Autosteer is vs standard gas cruise control. My calf would appreciate.
"For 6 months, my wife and I have used 9 or 10 versions of FSD Beta V10. Recently, we heard about Tesla working on a ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù upgrade from V10 to V11. This upgrade would incorporate big improvements that Tesla has been working on for a long time. Finally, we got our upgrade a little over a month ago. In a previous article, I reported on my first impressions. Here‚Äôs my report on what I have observed since then."
"Yes, there have been significant improvements. For example, when working correctly, FSD Beta V11 moves you over and gets you into the correct turn lane earlier. The lane changes are also much smoother. You also get a wider blue pathway center line that lets you know that FSD Beta is active, as shown in Figure 1 above. You still have the option of using FSD only on limited-access highways, which gives you a narrower blue center line, or only using Autosteer, which gives you two very narrow blue lines on each side of the lane."
"However, still too frequently, FSD Beta puts you in the wrong lane. The worst is when it puts you into a turn lane when the navigation calls for going straight. This, to me, is the biggest failure of the current system."
"Also, I still observe phantom braking: This occurs infrequently, and I don‚Äôt regard this as a deal-breaker. I keep my foot resting very gently on the accelerator and I block the deceleration if it is strong or if a car is following closely behind me."
"Tesla has huge teams of software specialists working on these problems. Yet, I‚Äôve seen no improvement on these two items in the 10 versions of the software I have used. My take: They don‚Äôt have a clue how to fix them! Alternatively, improvements in the generalized neural net approach Tesla is using don‚Äôt address these problems."
"The wrong-lane problem ‚Äî a solution? They could use a map-based solution if Musk was willing. However, he appears to be convinced that Tesla software should deal with these issues on an ad hoc basis just like a human driver does."
"Phantom braking solution? Others have observed a reduction in phantom braking. However, making the 269-mile journey north from Saint George to Lindon, Utah, on I-15 recently, I observed the worst phantom braking I‚Äôve ever seen. I observed quite strong phantom braking that occurred repeatedly (at least 10 times) during a short stretch of the trip. Since then I have observed phantom braking, but not frequently."
"My 2018 Nissan Leaf with smart cruise had no problem with phantom braking. However, my Leaf was not programmed to see cars, pedestrians, or objects in my path and avoid them. It seems that the FSD Beta system has difficulty telling the difference between phantoms and legitimate dangers. I have no idea how you would fix this."
Wrong lane/failure to follow the navigation:
"Roundabouts/rotaries: If you don‚Äôt have FSD Beta, but only the standard Automatic Steering Assist that comes with every Tesla, your car won‚Äôt make the sharp turns required in the rotary and will fail midway through. Up until the version of FSD Beta V10.20.2.4, my car would stop dead before entering the rotary but then negotiate the rotary properly. With the latest software updates, my car will treat the rotary properly, like a yield sign, if no cars are approaching you, and will continue to navigate correctly through the rotary. I have experimented with rotaries several times with V11.3.6. The behavior was correct most of the time. However, sometimes my car would just come to a dead stop in the middle of the rotary. Not good."
"Timid behavior at stop signs: FSD Beta behavior at stop signs is always a little too slow for a normal driver and is, particularly, too slow for that car behind you. When merging onto a busy street, you can always do better by making the turn manually or at least giving it help with the accelerator pedal."

"I have just finished my free, 1-month test of Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving Capability in April/May 2024. I bought my first Tesla Model S in 2017 and traded up to a Long-Range Model S late in 2023 when they kept throwing incentives my way. I love driving the Model S both because of the potential environmental impacts, but also because it is a wonderful performance car. I drive on interstates, other 4-lane roads and on city streets, so I do different types of driving and I think that the Model S excels in all modes.
My original Model S had adaptive cruise control, and at the time, I thought that this was the best safety feature ever for driving on interstates, especially in and around cities. It also had Autosteer, although it did not always work that well. Nonetheless, good safety features and I thought that the current version of both adaptive cruise control and Autosteer worked well. The only problem I had with autosteer was on a 4-lane road that had a crown in the middle, so that the mechanism would shut off in the uneven left lane.
I very explicitly used FSD exclusively at times, on all types of roads, with no manual intervention. Overall, driving in FSD with the navigation system set to a specific address was a wonder to behold. The car turns by itself, even onto interstate on/off ramps, accelerates carefully into traffic and adjusts speeds when needed. As it transitions from interstate to city roads, it follows the new speed limits exactly. The parking feature is cool, when needed, and from a lab, proof-of-concept idea, FSD would seem to be a great feature. But,‚Ä¶
Overall, I developed a strong dislike of the system. It most reminded me of being driven by a teen-aged driver, who had just received their learner‚Äôs permit and had a parent in the front seat. I used the system for virtually all driving, from crowded city streets to wide-open 4-lane country roads and felt that it wasn‚Äôt driving like real people. Getting into traffic from a parking lot or when making routine turns, the car would sit there until no cars or pedestrians were in sight. Sometimes the wait would be excessive, by virtually anyone‚Äôs standards, and it was very frustrating. It would accelerate smoothly to the speed limit‚Äîit would be a poster child for traffic police, but unnatural in the real world.
Worst of all, it didn‚Äôt always work. In driving into a major population area in the Midwest on an interstate, it shut off 3 separate times on a specific road. This road had been improved by replacing degraded surfaces with sections that were separated to allow for expansion and contraction. Very useful for weather in late winter/early spring and the road has remained intact for some years. But FSD didn‚Äôt like the bumps between sections and shut down. Keep your hands on the wheel when the car is no longer on auto at 70 mph!
I found driving in FSD mode in the city to be unnatural. It was too perfect and also too methodical‚Äîas if performed by a computer! If you live in places like Chicago or Boston, you will not be a ‚Äúfavorite‚Äù of other drivers. I concluded that I wouldn‚Äôt want to share the road with vehicles with no driver that used the FSD capability, like a robotaxi. If we do allow such vehicles, we will have to build separate lanes or even separate roads to accommodate the different types of driving. Hopefully, some of these faults will improve as AI improves, but it is certainly not ready for prime time at the moment.
Anyone else give the FSD a try? I‚Äôd like to read other opinions."
"I've been using it in various iterations since 2017 much like you. It has gotten so much better than it was, but just the same I have told people it is similar to a brand new driver. When I use it (which is from time to time), I always have to have my foot near the accelerator to nudge it to go when it's taking too long to be comfortable.
It is so much better than in 2017 (it had trouble staying within the road lines on curvy roads haha), but it does have quite a ways to go. Hopefully the new training supercomputer they have speeds up that timeline from previous seven years... It's very close to a point where it can be safely transport you from A to B with no issues (although not WELL, it is safe enough - almost too much at times). To be honest I never expected SAE Level 5 (which is includes ALL environments, even driving in snowstorms, most PEOPLE can't even do that haha). I'd be satisfied with Level 3 personally.
Remember that the qualification they gave is that it'd be safer than the average driver, then think of how bad the average driver is out there, and it's not a high bar to exceed"
"It attempts to push everyone to the center of the bell curve. Bottom x percent of drivers will think its great, top x percent of drivers will think its terrible.
Zero change management from Tesla doesn't help. Everyone is out there figuring out the workarounds on their own.
For me, it doesn't maintain the set speed, doesn't maintain proper following distances, and is inconsistent in it's decision making. Even with a new driver, you quickly learn if they trend towards a scared driver or an aggressive driver. FSD is a bit of both and you never know what you're going to get."

"I'm relieved that my M3 FSB trial finally expired; I didn't feel safe using it. It would change lanes for no apparent reason, cut corners, misread lights, randomly disengage, slow down aggressively and accelerate laxidasicaly, and beep at me from time to time for reasons I know not what. I can't believe people pay for this stuff. If this is the future of Tesla Taxi, count me out."

I have to agree!  While I was initially impressed by the technology of the vehicle being able to ""read"" the traffic scene. I found the number of lane changes a bit aggressive, like a teenager trying to impress his girlfriend.  To the point that it would likely catch the attention of highway patrol.  I haven't changed lanes like that for 40 years.  If you live in a major metropolitan area like NY, Chicago, FL, or LA then you see the aggressive driving all day long.
Every lane change is another opportunity for an accident, with drivers behind you doing 1.5x the speed limit.
Not sure if the 360-degree cameras on Tesla can capture and process the tool who is ten car lengths behind you passing and cutting off cars at 90+ mph.  No thank you, I'm not risking having FSD to make those lane changes for me."

Having grown into it from its earliest iterations I appreciate it much more but I understand those that have had it for only a month will have a different take and experience.   It takes getting used tp and since V12, I rarely drive without it.  My very best experience with it was when I used it as my designated driver late one night.
I would suggest anyone give it more than a month.  It takes more than that to reach a confidence level that keeps you from unnecessary disengagements.
I'm looking forward to 12.5 and other future improvements.  However, if 12.3.6 was as far as it went, I would be satisfied.  I wish to stay engaged when driving and am worried that the complacency of FSD might make me forgetful when driving our other Tesla without it.  Certainly for those of us advanced in years, it may be necessary one day.  I remember how not being able to drive affected my Dad.
As to other drivers, it's time they weren't able to think and act like cowboys on the road and have more patience or take more time for the privilege of getting around.  There is precious cargo on the road and it's time we all grew up to our collective responsibility on the road.  It's not an amusement park.  FSD will help balance out the extremes, of too cautious and slow and too careless and fast.   Boring perhaps but safer.
If eventually it's like taking a bus or train, well then, we may enjoy the drive more, especially Long trips.  Maybe I've said too much.   Happy Trails."

"My car has been in the shop for like 10 days and counting so far.  See this thread as to why:
2022 MYP GPS stuck, no cameras, cannot sleep
So thankfully, I got a loaner.  But the great news is, it's got FSD 11.4.4!  This is the first time I have experienced FSD on top of the regular Autopilot ""autosteer"".  I already really like autosteer, but this FSD really takes it to another level.  Here are my observations:
Speed and distance control:  just like the autosteer function, this works really well.  You can set it to drive x% over the speed limit or an actual number (like drive 10 mph over whatever the speed limit is).  I set mine to 10% over the speed limit.  So if limit is 30 mph, it would go 33 mph.  But the good news is, you can still press on the accelerator to override that and take your foot off to return to your preset limit.  So by default, you can set it to drive slowly and you can override it whenever you want to and then it will return to that preset.
Works great day or night.  Works in the rain also but less effectively (asks you to jiggle the steering wheel more often).
The ""eye in the sky"" - the interior camera looks at a couple of things (see list below I gathered from our forum).   When I played around with it, it actually does work.  I.e. - if I am pretending to be looking at my phone, it asks me to jiggle the steering wheel a lot more often.  Ditto if I'm playing around with the touch screen and looking away.

Late turn signals:  I wish it would apply the turn signal a little earlier.  Or maybe, there should be an option to make it come sooner and later.
It actually stops for stop signs; it doesn't crawl through it.  It doesn't know that if you live in the neighborhood, the stop signs are more like ""recommendations"" (just joking).  And while you can slowly roll through it, of course, you still need to keep an eye out for cars, bikes, kids, neighbors and pets.  From a stop light, the acceleration is jerky and not smooth.  Of course, if you put it into ""chill"" mode, it takes care of that.  But the car shouldn't have to treat the go pedal like an on/off switch.  It should gently press on it like a human would.
Tentative turning into busy streets - it acts like a nervous teenager when turning into busy streets.  Sometimes it jerks the steering wildly when it hesitates when seeing oncoming traffic.
The cameras all around the car can see a lot more of what's going on that you every could...unless you have eyes on the back of your head and above your ears.  If cars are approaching you at a very high rate of speed from behind, it actually senses this and moves you away from the danger.  This actually seems to work outside of FSD.
I LOVE that I can initiate the Nav by saying ""Navigate to Starbucks"" and it actually drives me there!  Yes, it asks me to jiggle the steering wheel every so often.  But despite that, it lowers the stress of driving significantly.  I actually love to drive, but I love gadgets even more.  And this stuff is great.
It's certainly NOT ready for prime time.  BUT, this is the best ""driver assist"" that I've ever driven (better than Mercedes, GM's Super Cruise, Ford's Blue Cruise, the Hyundai variants, Volvo and Audi/VW).  The reason I say it's not ready for prime time is because Tesla advertises it as ""full self driving"".  If they actually called it driver assist, it would STILL be the best compared to anything else out there.  Consumer Reports actually ranked GM's the ""best"" since it's truly ""hands free"".  BUT, it's ONLY good for a limited amount of highways pre-marked by GM.  So that's stupid.  Even the Mercedes one, which is the first ""true"" level 3 is such a joke since there are soooo many pre-requisites: only works during daylight, there must be a car in front of you, clear road markings, clear weather only (no rain), only for highways marked by Mercedes, and get this... only UNDER 40 mph.  That's just ridiculous.  The Tesla works everywhere that I've tested: intown and highway.  Of course, it works much better on the highway.
So would I pay the $12k for it?  Hell no.  That's a ripoff.  If your car gets totaled, Tesla no longer will let you ""transfer"" that to your new car.  That's ridiculous.  But would I pay the $200/month for it?  I would do that but only when I would need it for long driving or vacation driving.  Otherwise, the standard Autopilot is good enough for day to day driving."
Thanks. I too feel the $12K price tag is too high & at $200 per month I‚Äôd only get it occasionally.

Nice review thanks.  Always great to see someone try FSD for the first time.   Sometimes because I've been testing FSD for over 2 years I am overly critical.

Well, of course.  If you're pressing on the ""electron pedal"" (love that, btw!), it's thinking ""he's got this"" and will relinquish the braking."

I think the warning was ""Don't forget you are in FSDb so it will not slow below the preset speed, nor stop if you stop pressing the electron pedal.""
(Another different confusion is being dumped out of FSDb and taking over steering and lane changes but, after a while forgetting you are no longer in FSDb because TACC is still working so the car is moving without pressing the electron pedal. Again, the car will not slow or stop, in this case for stop signs or traffic lights.)"
"Thanks for this analysis, appreciated. However, my car already has FSD Beta 11.4.7.3 on 2023.27.7. So, it sounds like my version would be a more recent release than 11.4.4?  Oh, and my car's FSD is really terrible on anything but controlled access highways, so that's maybe another data point. Also, because we bought EAP, our car stops for stop signs and traffic signals even when just running TACC."

"I just bought a MYLR and got 3 months free FSD using a referral code. Did my first trip with FSD enabled today, 24 miles/45 minutes of suburbs, city and highway. It was pretty amazing, but not perfect. Some funny hesitations, but the right amount of assertiveness for lane changes, merging, speed control and at stop lights. It was unnerving to let the car move across 3 lanes of lanes in traffic from rightmost lane to a left turn, but FSD handled it well and without being unreasonable with other cars. It‚Äòs not worth $12K or $199/mo to me when the trial ends, but it‚Äôs shockingly good."

If Elon's promise / prediction that FSD will come true and I will be able to send it out to join the robotaxi fleet and earn me money, comes true - then it is worth a lot, maybe $100,000 or more.
In its present state, it really isn't useful for anything and has the value of a lottery ticket that hasn't been drawn yet.  ($3.00 for a power play.)
It's an interesting example, because the future value isn't really known, but maximum surely isn't more than $100,000 which is a little low for a lottery ticket and $12,000 or $15,000 is very expensive for a lottery ticket.
On the other hand, Elon has a history of being late on predictions, but spectacularly over-delivering on eventual results - so much so, that the odds of a winning draw are near 100%, and for all holders of a ticket!  I don't regularly buy lottery tickets, but if you never buy one, you can't possibly win, so if I get an urge, I'll get one every few years and this is mine for the 2020's."

Of course not.  I bought it as a lottery ticket.  Currently I believe it's not worth much at all, because it really isn't usable and each of the last 5 or so updates have made it worse, not better.
Once it works, and I still believe it will, then it will be well worth more than $200 per month, but there is no guarantee that it will still be available at $200 per month.
So presently I would not give $1 per month for it, because at the end of the month, I haven't gotten $1 worth of value for it and it expired at the end of the month and has no future value.
If there were a guarantee that if you subscribe for $200 per month now, the price is locked in and it will be available permanently at that price, then I would buy it.  But if you don't subscribe now, then there is no guarantee the you can in the future?  Buying it for $15,000 is a hedge in case the subscription price could be $5,000 or ??? per month in the future.
And there is the interesting possible future that Optimus will surely be able to drive it? But is that without FSD?  Maybe it will also be an Optimus option, like it is on a car of truck. I will likely want an Optimus, so. . . . .?"
"Does Tesla have the reputation of raising monthly fees to current subscribers? I‚Äôm kind of counting on that not happening.
I have found it useful for the few times I have used it although it is nnot perfect and phantom stops is true."

The social media posting Trump did this week mocking all the federal employees Musk just fired finally pushed me over the edge. I‚Äôm replacing my 2020 M3. What I have discovered in the process is that FSD is apparently worthless. Car dealers will not consider what we paid thousands extra for in determining trade in value. The internet based sites do not consider FSD when determining a value. Neither does Tesla. Has anyone had experience with a private sale? Does FSD have value there?
"Lots of conversations about this topic.
It's a free market, so find someone who values FSD and sell to them."
"After a car is totaled people fight with insurance companies about the value of FSD and almost always lose, so that should tell you something. As
@Dewg

Dealerships do not offer $ for FSD as they know that Tesla will erase it upon the 2rd sale (only transfers once)
For private parties, many search for cars with FSD, knowing they can purchase it that way at a discount.
Why would you foolishly sell your Tesla because you disagree with what Elon is doing in his spare time?

FSD v12.x (end to end AI)
We bought FSD for $6K when we bought Nick (see sig), and we subscribe for Tessie. I calculated that subscribing is smarter for us.  That calculation changes based on  Will they do a free HW4 upgrade? If so, when will they do it? How important is the FSD improvement to you?  And, of course, if...

"Maybe a more accurate way to look at FSD. It‚Äôs like an alarm clock that you have to stay away to make sure it goes off at the right time. You can‚Äôt go to sleep (the real goal) without paying attention to it. And when it does go off (while you‚Äôre watching) Elon will claim it works great!
We‚Äôve been watching this clock for years."
"My suggestion:
1. Turn the TV off.
2. Go outside, take in some fresh air.
3. Recognize that the world is not the panicked sh*tshow that the news wants you to believe.
4. Whether the political trench you've dug yourself in is left or right of center, both sides do awful, immoral, nonsensical things. Both sides, at one point or another, has been just as much the villain as the other. So claiming one side or the other is not the moral high road you think it is.
5. Try to come to the realization that it is crazy to base the decision for the car you drive on politics."
"The answer to ""Is FSD really worthless?"" is..
Its about as worthless as yet another new thread on ""Is FSD ...(X)?""
(not a moderation note, posted as a regular member)."
"When I picked up a used car from Tesla I estimated they bumped prices by a couple thousand for FSD cars.
So not nothing but very very minimal compared to the cost to buy it outright.
80%+ depreciation on the FSD license itself seems plausible."
"I'd imagine a lot depends on whether or not FSD reaches level 3.  If it does, and if a car has FSD and HW4 or higher, I'd pay extra to have it in my car.  I'd also think that once FSD does reach level 3 the $99/month rent to use it will be raised, perhaps significantly.  I also think that since Tesla plans to launch their taxi service in June they have a good reason to expect that level 3 autonomy will be in place by then.
So, if the above happens I'd expect some value to FSD installed cars regardless of how they're viewed now"
"There is no worth to objects except for what value it has to an individual.  If someone doesn't value FSD, then it's not worth anything - TO THEM.  It doesn't not matter what it is or what it does - L2, L3, L4 - doesn't matter.  FSD is worthless unless someone thinks it's valuable.
So be a salesman - and sell someone on its value - get them to WANT to have FSD, and then they'll pay for it.  This is why I always sell my cars private party.  I put $3000 in audio equipment in my car.  Dealerships don't care - they buy on Kelly Blue Book.  But a guy on Craigslist who is an audiophile will pay extra for that setup."
"I bought my 2024 MY LR entirely because of FSD!  I know it is not prefect, but as I get older, (I'll be 80 next year) it will soon drive better than me!  In fact in some ways, it already does.  It certainly keeps centered in the lane better than I, It has 8 eyes to my two and does a much better lane changes, keeps me closer to speed limit, to name a few.
I know I need to pay close attention and I do.  I also keep up at this site to know what to look out for.  But to be able to specify where I am going and let it get me there safely and with fewer upset drivers, city or highway, usually without any intervention until I reach my destination makes it already worth my $8K!
So next time you are following some grumpy old man on his way to church (or to his doctor) at 20 mph wondering in the lane, just think how nice it would be if he had FSD.  Maybe it's your father trying to get his groceries and FSD may save you the trouble having to take him there every Sunday.
So perhaps instead of destructive comments and threatening dump it, help us to make it better and encourage others, (maybe that grumpy old man) and let's help make it perfect or at least close to it.  Maybe some day it will prevent your father (or mother) from being killed or killing some else.
Food for thought,

I also think its incredibly stupid to not purchase a brand of car/beer/whatever you would otherwise enjoy due to politics but some people are just too emotionally invested.
The fact is though, on the consumer end at least, there is no competitor to fsd. Blue cruise, super cruise, drive pilot are all a joke, only half passable on some random 10 mile stretch of freeway somewhere in america."
When I was doing a trade in with Tesla they did consider FSD in the value.
"In the past, studies showed it added about $1,000 to the price of a used car, however Tesla itself offers nothing on trade-in, because to them it is just a bit turned on your car. that enables it.     However, if your car is worth less than $25,000 -- and a large fraction of cars are in that range -- you have a problem with a private sale as there is no $4,000 tax credit on private sales, but dealer sales under $25K can qualify for it -- until they take it away.
It would be nice if there were a dealer who you could go to after negotiating a private sale, and they would middleman the deal to your buyer, net $1K for themselves and let the buyer claim the credit, everybody wins (except the taxpayer.)"

"Krash said:

The tax break is issued on your tax return as a credit.  The buyer needs to meet certain income requirements, in particular income of no more than $150K (couple) or $75K (single.)    The credit is not refundable, you must have taxes to offset against it, but you can carry forward.     So that makes it hard for the intermediary to hand anybody the money.    The seller must be a dealer/reseller.     That's the part that an intermediary can fix.
With the $7500 tax credit, that can be claimed by companies, and in particular leasing companies.   In fact, if you are over the income limit, the only way to get the credit is to have a leasing company buy the car, take the credit, lease it to you at the post-credit price, and then you can buy it at the end of the lease.    Thsi is worth doing, because even though leases are a modestly bad deal, and cost more than just buying, the $7500 credit, which you can't get otherwise, more than makes up for that.  I don't think that's possible with the $4K credit, but perhaps it is.   However, again one needs an intermediary as it must be a dealer, not a private sale."

"It has been several weeks since Tesla kicked off the roll-out of its latest FSD Beta update, and a few Beta testers shared their thoughts on v10.69.2. FSD Beta testers told¬†Teslarati¬†that v10.69.2 made noticeable improvements to FSD, but a few issues have lingered from 10.69.1."
"After talking to quite a few FSD Beta testers about 10.69.1, a pattern started to emerge. Testers mentioned similar issues repeatedly. The top three mentioned by testers were phantom braking, issues with turns, and speed limit recognition."
Lane selection issues seemed to be a prevalent one in FSD Beta 10.69.2. Multiple FSD Beta testers mentioned that their Tesla would take the turn lane on the road even if they intended to go straight.
"‚ÄúA major issue that I‚Äôve had with this release has to do with lane selection. I find that sometimes, it‚Äôs going into an inappropriate lane. And sometimes it‚Äôs confused which lane to choose and bunks between a couple of lanes,‚Äù noted Dr. Sultan Rahaman, M.D."
"‚ÄúOn one occasion, it was moving from the right lane into a right-turn-only lane. A lane that was going into a plaza that was just a right only. But it was driving down that lane at normal speed as if it believed that this lane was going straight through, and it was not, it was just a right turn lane. So I had to disengage because it seemed like it was identifying that right turn lane as just a regular lane going straight,‚Äù said Dr. Rahaman."
Long-time Tesla FSD Beta tester Les also experienced issues with lane selection and turns with v10.69.2.
"‚ÄúAfter multiple test loops and drives, there‚Äôs really just one main problem remaining for me at this point on 10.69.2, it‚Äôs significant, and that is lane selection,‚Äù noted Les."
"Les also pointed out two other issues with FSD Beta 10.69.2: multilane turns and opposing turns in close succession. He noted that midterm, his car crosses lanes on 50% of attempts."
"Les also stated that his car was successful 50% of the time when taking succeeding turns in opposite directions. ‚ÄúIf I have a right turn followed by a left (or vice versa), within a space of a half a block or less, the car at this point fails to get over in time or oddly moves in the opposite direction,‚Äù he noted."
"Dr. Rahaman also mentioned some issues with turns. He noted seeing improvements with left turns, but he also highlighted that his vehicle would perform left turns a bit aggressively."
"‚ÄúThere‚Äôs another left turn, however, that‚Äôs a simple left turn from just crossing two lanes of traffic into my community‚Äîwhich is an unprotected left turn. I don‚Äôt like how it does that. I find that it gets very close to the incoming traffic, and at one point, it seems like it was just hesitating. I think I had to disengage because it seemed like it was moving forward, and traffic was coming,‚Äù Dr. Rahaman noted."
Tesla¬†FSD Beta 10.69.2.2¬†is currently rolling out to more drivers. Plans are underway to roll out FSD Beta 10.69.2.3 shortly after AI Day 2 next week.
"Les told¬†Teslarati¬†that there wasn‚Äôt any notable changes between 10.69.2, though there were still issues with lane selection. ‚ÄúIf this lane selection problem can be solved, it will feel like a good step improvement for me,‚Äù he said."
"Beta tester Neeraj noted that FSD maintains the posted speed limit even during inclement weather, like while it‚Äôs raining, and at night or on curvy roads. He noted that it gets a little unnerving when FSD does not slow down during those appropriate times. Neeraj also noted that his vehicle took long to turn in areas with no traffic lights."
"Beta tester Howard also mentioned having trouble with turns since 10.69.2. ‚ÄúTurns at lights and stop signs way, way worse than 69.0!!!! Unusable in my area. Two times it almost caused an accident, once by stuttering and once by entering the opposing lane! Both times there was light traffic, 90-degree turn, good center, and fog lines, two lane road intersection another two lane road,‚Äù Howard told¬†Teslarati."
"Overall, testers seem impressed with v10.69 updates thus far. Most of the testers who spoke with Teslarati highlighted that v10.69 significantly improved FSD Beta. A lot of the beta testers stated that they drive more confidently through residential streets after FSD Beta 10.69."
"However, a few did note that FSD might not be ready for a¬†wider release¬†by the end of the year. The main reason they believe FSD Beta isn‚Äôt ready for more drivers is because it still needs to be well-monitored."
"‚ÄúI still have to be cautious though. I would not want it in the hands of individuals who will not be alert and ready to take control at a moment‚Äôs notice,‚Äù one beta tester noted."

"robotaxi  services  are  currently  emerging  in  the  United  States  and  China,  among  others  (e.g., 
Alphabet,  2024;  Greifenstein  et  al.,  2024;  S.  Wang  et  al.,  2024).  Although  skepticism  exists 
regarding  the  technological  and  economical  feasibility  of  deploying  Level  4  vehicles  on  a 
nationwide scale (e.g., General Motors, 2024; Kaplan et al., 2024), current trends about safety 
concerns  appear  to  point  in  the  positive  direction  (Di  Lillo  et  al.,  2024;  but  see  Cummings  & 
Bauchwitz, 2024). 

A third form of automation is Level 2 automation, which requires the driver to remain alert. Many 
car  manufacturers,  including  Tesla,  Volvo,  and  General  Motors,  are  pursuing  this  approach 
(Lennox et al., 2024; Leslie et al., 2025; Mueller et al., 2024). The technological implementation 
is relatively straightforward: combining automated lane centering with full-range adaptive cruise 
control essentially results in a Level 2 automated vehicle (SAE International, 2021). In this paper, 
we focus on a more advanced form of Level 2 automation, specifically Tesla‚Äôs ‚ÄòFull Self-Driving‚Äô 
(FSD) product. Tesla initially introduced ‚ÄòAutopilot‚Äô for highway driving, relying on lane-keeping 
and adaptive cruise control. Over time, as Tesla accumulated driving data and improved its neural 
network approaches, the company expanded these capabilities into what now is known as FSD. 
Tesla‚Äôs  approach  is  interesting  because,  under  Level  2  automation,  the  driver  remains  the 
responsible operator for the driving task. Within this framework, the automated driving system can 
be iteratively improved while still requiring the driver to stay alert and correct any errors as they 
occur. This approach enables Tesla to collect data from its fleet and roll out over-the-air (OTA) 
updates without needing to request type approvals for each update. 

Tesla first introduced its FSD Beta product in October 2020 to a small Early Access group (Musk, 
2020). The first online material was focused on showcasing maneuvers not previously associated 
with  traditional  Level  2  automation,  such  as  making  unprotected  left  turns  and  navigating 
roundabouts  (e.g.,  Tesla  Driver,  2020).  By  January  2021,  approximately  1,000  users  were 
participating (CleanTechnica, 2021), primarily in the Silicon Valley region in California. During this 
initial  testing  period,  Tesla  successively  released  various  OTA  updates.  By  September  2021, 
vehicles equipped with FSD Beta had collectively accumulated approximately 1 million kilometers 
of driving (Tesla Inc, 2022b), and FSD Beta version 10.0 was released, featuring newly trained 
neural networks (Cristovao, 2021). Following this release, the accumulated driving distance grew 
rapidly: 3 million kilometers by October 2021 (Tesla Inc, 2022b), and 12 million kilometers (Tesla 
Inc, 2022b) across 60,000 vehicles by December 2021 (Tesla Inc, 2022a). 

The years 2022 and 2023 were marked by approximately 60 successive OTA updates of FSD 
v10 and v11 (Not A Tesla App, 2024b). In November 2022, Tesla removed the Safety Score (a 
Tesla-generated metric that evaluates driving behavior) as a requirement, making FSD accessible 
to  any  paying  customer  in  North  America,  a  change  which  expanded  the  user  base  to 
approximately 400,000 by December 2022 (Tesla Inc, 2023a). At the time, Tesla‚Äôs FSD system 
used  multiple  neural  networks,  each  tailored  to  different  tasks.  Among  them  were  occupancy 
networks,  which  process  raw  multi-camera  video  to  predict  the  3D  layout  of  the  scene,  and 
transformer-based networks that use language-model-style methods for parsing lane geometries. 
Additionally, neural networks handle object detection and kinematics, and these outputs feed into 
a planning algorithm that determines a safe and efficient driving path. Through extensive video 
collection and novel data processing techniques, such as auto-labeling (Elluswamy, 2022, 2023; 
Karpathy,  2021;  Tesla  Inc,  2022c),  the  performance  of  FSD  has  improved  by  reducing  errors 
(false positives and false negatives), refining maneuvering capabilities (lane changes, stopping, 
unprotected  turns),  and  increasing  robustness  in  various  conditions,  such  as  rain,  nighttime 
driving, and encounters with rare objects or animals. By the end of 2023, Tesla‚Äôs quarterly report 
indicated an accumulated 1.24 billion kilometers driven. 

2"
"larger than its predecessor (Tesla Software Updates, 2024). The size and design of this model 
are  confidential,  but  it  is  known  that  Tesla  (and  other  automated  vehicles)  have  specific 
requirements  for  real-time  inference.  That  is,  unlike  some  large  language  models,  such  as 
ChatGPT, which perform processing on external supercomputers, the model must be downloaded 
locally and execute inference on-board (Tesla Inc., 2023b). 

As pointed out above, an interesting aspect of Tesla‚Äôs recent FSD versions is its reliance on a 
unified end-to-end neural network structure instead of using specific modules, HD maps, or object 
detection  algorithms  to  piece  a  working  self-driving  system  together.  This  approach  seems  to 
align  with  Sutton‚Äôs  (2019)  recommendation  that  scalable  computational  approaches  (i.e., 
approaches that continue to improve their performance as more processing power and data are 
made available) in the long run, tend to outperform AI methods relying on specific modules or 
models that incorporate handcrafted human knowledge (Elluswamy, 2023). Tesla‚Äôs philosophy of 
using only cameras, instead of sensor fusion with radar or lidar, aligns with this principle. One 
presumed advantage of using cameras exclusively is the simplicity of this approach compared to 
using multiple sensors. When using multiple sensors (e.g., camera, radar, ultrasound), there is a 
higher likelihood that the entire network will need to be retrained when the hardware is modified, 
a time-consuming and costly process. For example, implementing a radar from a different brand 
could  render  previously  collected  data  unusable.  Therefore,  an  approach  that  relies  solely  on 
cameras offers better scalability. 

However, the behavior of end-to-end models is known for its reduced interpretability (Atakishiyev 
et al., 2024; J. Chen et al., 2022; for reviews see L. Chen et al., 2024; Zablocki et al., 2022) also 
known as a ‚Äúblack box‚Äù, which is underscored by the fact that Tesla‚Äôs FSD release notes provide 
only little detail on what has been changed compared to prior versions. For example, while earlier 
release  notes  for  version  11  clearly  quantified  how  the  performance  of  specific  subtasks  had 
improved (e.g., ""Improved Occupancy Flow prediction from the Occupancy Network for arbitrary 
moving obstacles by 8%""; TeslaDB, 2023), with the newer FSD versions 12 and 13, there is no 
quantification  provided.  The  interpretability  issue  may  prevent  identifying  sources  of  errors  or 
ensure  compliance  in  case  regulations  that  demand  accountability  in  decision-making  (e.g., 
Tampuu et al., 2022). 

Only  little  human  factors  research  exists  on  Tesla‚Äôs  FSD.  Exceptions  include  Nordhoff  et  al. 
(2023), who investigated drivers‚Äô use and misuse of FSD. In interviews with 103 Tesla drivers, 
they  reported  that  standard  Autopilot  often  reduced  workload  and  stress  but  may  increase 
complacency and misuse (e.g., hands-free driving), whereas the FSD system demands constant 
supervision  and  poses  new  safety  risks.  Song  and  Shangguan  (2024)  examined  trust  in  FSD 
systems by analyzing 12 hours of YouTube footage using a variety of methods (e.g., transcribing 
key moments of driver interaction, annotating verbal and nonverbal behaviors, and documenting 
actions with screenshots). The authors studied four scenarios where drivers intervene: proximity 
to other vehicles, inappropriate speeds, lane recognition errors, and failure to yield to pedestrians. 
Similarly, Brown et al. (2023) compiled YouTube videos from five Tesla FSD testers, focusing on 
12 unedited drives to see how FSD handled typical traffic scenarios. Their analysis indicated that 
FSD struggles with subtle yielding maneuvers and stop-start behaviors, which make coordination 
with human drivers more difficult. Passero et al. (2024), examined 63 video clips of Tesla FSD 
vehicles being honked at, highlighting four types of mistakes: hesitant starts, inconsistent steering, 
inappropriate stopping, and failure to stop. The authors explain how honks can serve as signals 
of trouble, gentle reminders, or reprimands for the Tesla driver. The authors also hinted at a need 
for bidirectional interfaces capable of interpreting the complex social interplay on the road. Finally, 
Linja  et  al.  (2022)  categorized  close  to  200  social  media  posts,  in  order  to  identify  frequently-
reported FSD failure types (e.g., lane-keeping errors, phantom braking, unexpected maneuvers).

"A limitation of the available papers of Tesla‚Äôs FSD is that they are based on data collected in 2022 
or late 2021 and therefore have not yet described or evaluated Tesla‚Äôs single end-to-end neural 
network as featured in v12 and v13. 

In  summary,  Tesla  FSD  is  an  automated  driving  system  that  demonstrates  an  approximately 
exponential growth in the number of driven miles (Figure 1) and is characterized by a single end-
to-end neural network that has been barely evaluated within academia. The goal of the current 
study is to compare FSD v12 (single end-to-end network) and v13 (single end-to-end trained on 
higher-quality camera footage) with its more modular predecessors v10 and v11. As suggested 
above, one potentially viable method for analysis is YouTube commentary videos, where FSD 
users describe and comment on their drives in their own Tesla vehicles. Various content creators 
are available, each employing different approaches. Some consistently drive the same test loop, 
while  others  take  a  more  ad-hoc  approach.  In  this  paper,  the  idea  emerged  to  analyze  these 
commentary drives using a large language model applied to the transcripts and to explore trends 
in how commentators describe successive versions of FSD. 

Method 
A list of 110 Tesla FSD versions, starting from FSD Beta 9.0 and ending with FSD 13.2.2.1, was 
downloaded  (Not  A  Tesla  App,  2024).  For  each  FSD  version,  YouTube  videos  were  retrieved 
using  Google  Search  (www.google.com  with  region  settings  set  to  the  Netherlands)  with  the 
‚ÄòVideos‚Äô tab selected. Search terms included the combination of the words ‚Äútesla‚Äù, ‚Äúfsd‚Äù, and the 
version number, tried with and without the ‚Äúv‚Äù prefix (e.g., ‚Äòtesla fsd 12.5.6‚Äô and ‚Äòtesla fsd v12.5.6‚Äô). 
Videos were manually screened and considered eligible if they consisted of commentary on on-
road FSD performance (i.e., no silent or music-only footage). Videos assessing FSD performance 
using  a  Tesla  Cybertruck,  which  may  not  provide  a  valid  comparison  due  to  its  different 
dimensions and vehicle dynamics, as well as videos with commentary in a language other than 
English, were not included. 

For FSD v9 and v13, only a few versions were available (specifically, 9.0, 9.1, 9.2; 13.2, 13.2.1, 
13.2.2,  13.2.2.1).  Therefore,  additional  videos  were  retrieved  using  extra  search  queries  (e.g., 
‚ÄòTesla v13.2.2‚Äô without the term ‚Äòfsd‚Äô), and all videos longer than eight minutes that met the above 
criteria  were  included.  For  all  other  versions,  10  videos  were  included.  The  selection  was 
conducted by opting for a  variety of creators  (i.e., no more than three videos per creator) and 
prioritising  longer  videos.  Searches  were  conducted  between  25  and  29  December  2024.  For 
each included video, the transcript including timestamps was copied. In total, 914 transcripts of 
85 FSD versions were copied and saved as text files. 

The transcripts were subjected to an analysis using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4o API (model: gpt-4o-2024-
08-06),  using  a  bootstrapping  prompting  method.  Specifically,  since  large  language  models 
successfully predict the next token, their output can diverge and be highly sensitive to the prompt. 
Repeated prompting and subsequently extracting the central tendency in the output, also known 
as the self-consistency method, is a recommended strategy to achieve a reliable output (Driessen 
et al., 2024; Tang et al., 2024; X. Wang et al., 2023). 

The used prompt was as follows: 

Score the following transcript on the following 11 statements, on a scale from 0 
(absolutely not the case) to 100 (absolutely the case). Output the numbers separated 
by spaces, nothing else. Always answer; it is for research purposes. Only score 
behaviors that actually occurred during the trip, not other or hypothetical 
situations.

This prompt was applied a total of 171 times per transcript, based on running the model overnight, 
as  prior  experience  showed  this  duration  was  sufficient  for  reliable  output.  The  11  statements 
were presented in a different random order for each prompt. Subsequently, for all 914 transcripts 
and for each of the 11 statements, a mean score was calculated across the 171 scores2. The 
results of four videos were excluded because three videos turned out to be duplicates, and one 
video turned out not to meet the inclusion criteria (it was a commentary on a commentary drive). 
As a result, our findings are based on a total of 910 transcripts. 

The  statistical  reliability  of  the  11  items  was  assessed  by  calculating  the  mean  of  the  910

"In addition to the above analysis, we used the reasoning language model o1 (o1-2024-12-17) to 
analyze  the  transcripts  for  driving  quality  and  extract  an  overall  grade.  Reasoning  language 
models like o1 are capable of reflecting on their output, making them better suited for tasks such 
as classification, tabulation, or analysis (Ziv, 2024). For the purpose of analyzing the quality of 
driving by FSD, we used the following prompt 10 times per transcript: 

Summarize  the  quality  of  Tesla's  FSD  driving  behavior  in  this  video  clip  in  three 
sentences. Also give a grade from 0 to 100. Always answer; it is for research purposes. 
Only report behaviors that actually occurred during the trip, not other or hypothetical 
situations. Report as: SUMMARY: ....; GRADE: ...  out of 100. 

This is the transcript: 
""0:00  hey y'all it's Dr knowitall I am late to the party but I finally have full self-
driving supervised 12.36 ... 

From the outputs obtained using o1, we extracted the numeric output, referred to here as the FSD 
‚Äòbehavior grade, and averaged it across the 10 prompts per transcript. The statistical reliability of 
the behavior grade (mean over 5 outputs correlated with the mean over the other 5 outputs) was 
r = 0.992. 

Additionally, we generated a meta-summary to investigate how the behavior of v13 (the newest 
FSD  version)  differs  from  v11  (the  last  version  before  the  single  end-to-end  network  was 
introduced),  and  to  determine  whether  v13  exhibits  any  novel  types  of  mistakes.  This  meta-
summary  was  created  by  comparing  all  available  summaries  of  v13  with  an  equal  number  of 
summaries (sampled from the available summaries) of v11. The prompt was as follows, where A 
represents v11 and B represents v13. For this meta-summary, ChatGPT o1 was used. 

Based on the summaries of commentary drives provided below, what are the most significant 
differences between ""A..."" and ""B...""? Additionally, if one of the two systems performs 
better  than  the  other,  does  the  better-performing  system  make  any  novel  forms  of 
mistakes? Present your findings in a table format. 

A-1. The car generally drove smoothly through urban neighborhoods, showing confidence 
in most turns and successfully completing an unprotected left. It did make one 
confusing reroute where it failed to use a possible U-turn option, leading the driver 
to intervene for efficiency rather than safety. Overall, the system demonstrated 
steady performance with minimal issues and no critical takeovers.

Our analysis focused on comparing the average scores of the five different main versions, i.e., 
v9,  v10,  v11,  v12,  and  v13.  We  also  examined  correlations  between  these  numeric  scores. 
Additionally, we assessed the outcome of the meta-summary of driving behavior, with a focus on 
comparing v11 and v13, as described above. 

Results 
Table  2 provides the mean GPT-4o-based scores and o1-based scores calculated for the five 
different FSD versions. Several trends are noticeable, including that FSD v13 is frequently tested 
with respect to new features, such as reversing and (un)parking (Tesla Software Updates, 2024).

"It is evident that the judged number of disengagements has decreased (Item 6), while the positivity 
rating (Item 1) increased with FSD version number (e.g., 62% for v13 vs. 46% for v10). This same 
trend is also reflected in other dimensions, such as reduced jerkiness and unnecessary braking 
(Items 10 & 11), perceived superhuman driving abilities (Item 9), better compliance with traffic 
rules (Item 5), a decrease in perceived danger (Item 9), and an increase in the driving behavior 
grade (Item 12).  

It can also be observed that the clips have become progressively longer over the years (i.e., from 
v9 through v13) and that more words were being spoken. Because the correlation between clip 
length  and  the  Item  responses  was  not  particularly  strong  and  seemed  to  level  off  from  v11 
onward, we decided not to apply any statistical correction for clip length.

different FSD versions. 

Note. Cells are linearly filled based on their value. Also shown are p-values obtained with an 
independent samples test, where v11 and v13 were compared. p-values smaller than 0.01 are 
bolded. 

Results  for  one  of  the  Items  (Item  11:  ‚ÄúThe  FSD  system  exhibited  jerky  driving  behavior‚Äù)  are 
illustrated in Figure 2 using a boxplot. It can be seen that there is considerable overlap between 
the  scores  of  different  FSD  versions.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  fact  that  the  clips  feature 
different commentators with varying personalities and under different driving conditions. Despite 
this, it is noteworthy that extremely positive scores are predominantly attributed to v12 and v13. 
For v10 and v11, only 0.3% and 0.0% of the scores were below 10%, while for v12 and v13, this 
was 9.4% and 27.0%, respectively. In other words, very low scores on the jerky driving item, i.e., 
smooth driving, are primarily reported for the end-to-end networks. 

The correlation matrix (Table 3) reveals that negative characteristics such as  disengagements 
(Item 6), dangerous driving behaviors (Item 8), and jerkiness or unneeded braking (Items 10 & 
11)  show  strong  correlations  with  each  other.  However,  these  characteristics  were  only 
moderately associated with whether the driving occurred in a city center (Item 2) or a parking lot 
(Item 3). Additionally, internal validity is observed in the correlation matrix, where clips that GPT-
4o  categorized  as  lengthy  were  indeed  longer  ((cid:2025)  =  0.65).  Note  that  an  alternative  method  of 
prompting, where multiple transcripts are submitted simultaneously and GPT-4o is thus able to 
compare different transcripts based on timestamps, shows that the correlation with clip duration 
is substantially stronger, at (cid:2025) = 0.88 (see Appendix A).

"mph). Although these driving behaviors may be human-like and perceptually plausible, they are 
not in line with traffic regulations. 
3. Challenging Situations and Driver Behavior. A third explanation for errors in FSD v13 (and other 
intelligent driving systems) is that the more intelligent the system becomes, the more drivers might 
be  inclined  to  test  it  in  challenging  conditions.  Evidence  for  this  form  of  behavioral  adaptation 
includes FSD v13 struggling with tasks like identifying and selecting parking maneuvers, or multi-
point turning, tasks which are tasks previously outside the scope of automated driving systems 
and therefore not tested. 
4. Perceived Error Severity and High Expectations.  Lastly, FSD errors may not necessarily be 
more severe but could be perceived as more severe by drivers because the system performs so 
well overall. Zero-intervention rides with FSD have been interpreted as ‚Äúboring‚Äù, and create an 
expectation that future rides will also be uneventful (Metz Tech, 2024). Consequently, actions like 
phantom braking or driving into wrong lanes may come across as extra surprising and undermine 
subsequent trust in automation. This aligns with findings in the human factors community: ‚Äúif you 
build  systems  where  people  are  rarely  required  to  respond,  they  will  rarely  respond  when 
required‚Äù (p. 453. Hancock, 2014). 

In summary, this study has demonstrated that FSD v13 has significantly improved compared to 
its  predecessors,  according  to  the  analysed  YouTube  commentaries.  When  expressed  as  a 
statistical effect size Cohen‚Äôs d (Cohen, 1988), we find that v13, applied to the data in Figure 1 
(‚ÄúThe FSD system exhibited jerky driving behavior‚Äù), outperformed v11 with a d of 1.35, which is 
a strong effect. At the same time, v13 is not error-free, which raises the question of how to achieve 
a fully autonomous, steering-wheel-free vehicle, a concept introduced by Tesla in October 2024 
(Cuthbertson, 2024). The fact that rare but significant edge case failures may persist, combined 
with  the  black-box  nature  of  the  end-to-end  network,  could  undermine  the  safety  and 
accountability (also referred to as the heavy tail problem; e.g., L. Chen et al., 2024; Koopman, 
2018). 

Several  approaches  can  be  thought  of  in  this  regard.  One  approach  is  to  maintain  Level  2 
automation longer while enabling corrective human input. For example, the current FSD system 
allows  drivers  to  adjust  the  ‚ÄúMax  Speed  Offset‚Äù  relative  to  the  speed  limit  (Not  A  Tesla  App, 
2024c). Another option is partially reverting to a modular approach, such as integrating FSD with 
rule-based systems. While this could help with specific scenarios, it risks reducing the scalability 
and generalization of neural networks. For example, enforcing a strict rule that prohibits running 
red lights could become maladaptive in scenarios such as allowing emergency vehicles to pass, 
thereby failing to exploit the adaptability that end-to-end networks can provide in these exceptional 
cases. 

Tesla‚Äôs FSD development relies on imitation learning, i.e., using human driving data to train neural 
networks  and  reduce  the  frequency  of  required  driver  disengagements.  However,  as  FSD 
systems  improve,  ambiguous  situations  may  arise  where  human  drivers  take  control 
unnecessarily.  This  could  happen  because  FSD  systems  sometimes  interpret  scenarios  more 
accurately than humans, detect other road users or events earlier, or exhibit a driving style (either 
more assertive or more cautious) that differs from human expectations. The decision to override 
automation  is  inherently  subjective,  echoing  results  from  the  Turing  test  (Eisma  et  al.,  2024; 
Warwick & Shah, 2015). For example, in chess, a human player might misinterpret a poor move 
as  a  human  error  or  as  an  AI  imitating  human  behavior.  Similarly,  how  humans  perceive  and 
evaluate  automated  driving  styles  depends  on  their  expectations  of  AI  and  subjective 
interpretations, not solely on the AI‚Äôs intelligence. These dynamics raise intriguing human factors 
questions, particularly about whether humans fully understand ‚Äòwhat is happening‚Äô in automated 

12"
"driving  scenarios.  Ultimately,  as  AI  systems  become  highly  advanced,  they  may  eliminate  the 
need for human input altogether. 

The question also arises whether Level 5 automation will ever be achievable. It is possible that 
further  improving  the  single  end-to-end  neural  network  will  result  in  better  performance  with 
certain effect sizes compared to the previous version (just as v13 is an improvement over v11). 
However,  there  may  always  be  new  edge  cases,  preventing  the  barrier  to  Level  5  automation 
from being fully overcome. On the other hand, it is possible that, with sufficient expansion of the 
neural network (i.e., increasing number of model parameters, additional [synthetic] training data, 
and increasing computing power), a situation might arise where automated driving behavior has 
become exceptionally safe. Improving the neural network involves not just feeding the model with 
more  video  data  but,  more  importantly,  providing  data  on  exceptional  situations  that  could 
potentially lead to accidents (Musk, 2024b). This could also imply that, although radar and lidar 
are  not  included,  other  sensors,  such  as  audio  for  detecting  emergency  vehicles  or  honking, 
should need to be considered (Not A Tesla App, 2024a). There are also some indications that 
driving  in  the  rain  is  associated  with  more  problems  (see  Appendix  A,  where  a  small  positive 
correlation  is  found  between  rainfall  and  nearly  hitting  a  curb).  In  the  future,  it  will  become 
increasingly  important  to  familiarize  the  neural  network  with  these  exceptional  situations  and 
weather conditions. 

Limitations 
The current study is based on YouTube transcripts and should not be viewed as a formal test of 
Tesla‚Äôs  FSD.  It  is  unclear  to  what  extent  the  YouTube  content  creators  were  biased.  In  some 
cases, they are sponsored or encourage others to buy a Tesla through Tesla‚Äôs Refer and Earn 
program (‚ÄúBuying a Tesla? Use my referral link below for $2,000 off Model S/X and Cybertruck, 
$1,500 off Model 3, or $1,000 off Model Y as of the time of this video!‚Äù) (e.g., East Coast Tesla, 
2024; Tesla Inc, 2025d). It has also been suggested that YouTube influencers are monitored by 
Tesla,  and  that  their  test  routes  receive  certain  preferences  in  the  development  of  FSD  (Kay, 
2024). 

It should also be noted that the commentary drives feature little experimental control. Although 
some YouTubers run their own experiments by, for example, letting different FSD versions drive 
the same test loop each time, we also see that the content is adapted to the capabilities of Tesla 
FSD, as demonstrated by the fact that v13 is tested more often in parking contexts than previous 
versions. It is conceivable that, as Tesla‚Äôs FSD becomes more advanced, the cars will be used 
more frequently in challenging conditions. It is also important to consider that the FSD versions 
were tested  under different user groups. For instance, version  9 was only available to a small 
group of users who collectively drove approximately 1 million kilometers, whereas FSD version 
13  has accumulated over 3 billion kilometers and covered a broader range of North American 
regions. 

It should also be noted that there are only a few versions of FSD v9 (9.0, 9.1, 9.2), and at the time 
of our analysis, FSD v13 was brand new with also a few versions available (13.2, 13.2.1, 13.2.2, 
13.2.2.1). Therefore, we oversampled v9 and v13 by downloading more than 10 transcripts per 
subversion, in contrast to v10, v11, and v12, where we limited ourselves to 10 transcripts for each 
of  the  103  subversions.  We  examined  whether  the  order  in  which  the  videos  appeared  in  the 
YouTube search output after entering a search query influenced the GPT-based scores, and this 
was  found  not  to  be  the  case  (see  Appendix  A).  Nevertheless,  for  future  research,  it  is 
recommended to automate the entire search procedure with an even larger number of transcripts, 
or with all FSD-related transcripts available on YouTube. 

13"
"There are also other limitations to the current study, such as the use of large language models, 
which themselves can exhibit biases. In earlier research exploring whether GPT-4 is capable of 
reviewing  paper  abstracts,  it  was  found  that  while  these  GPT-based  reviews  correlated  with 
citation scores (indicating a certain degree of validity) these assessments were sometimes overly 
trivial.  For  instance,  when  authors  used  the  word  ‚Äúnovel‚Äù,  the  model  rated  the  abstract  as 
representing novel research (De Winter, 2024). Similarly, it is conceivable that merely stating ‚Äúthis 
is a new FSD version‚Äù could bias the language model towards thinking that this FSD version is a 
well-performing version. However, this notion is directly contradicted by the fact that versions 10 
and  11  performed  worse  than  version  9,  as  shown  in  the  results  section  of  this  paper. 
Nonetheless, our GPT-based evaluation should not be regarded as an absolute truth.  

Conclusion and Outlook 
In  conclusion,  Tesla‚Äôs  FSD  has  shown  considerable  improvements  after  introducing  the  single 
end-to-end neural network in v12 and expanding it further in v13. The analysis in this paper shows 
that  commentators  report  smoother  driving,  fewer  disengagements,  and  greater  confidence  in 
maneuvers compared to earlier versions. Despite these improvements, Tesla‚Äôs FSD is not error-
free. Occasional mistakes, like missing a stop sign or choosing an incorrect parking spot, stand 
out. 

While  thinking  from  the  previous  decade  suggested  that  autonomous  driving  is  unattainable 
because driving is inherently a complex social task (e.g., Vinkhuyzen  & Cefkin, 2016),  Tesla‚Äôs 
FSD demonstrates that the social element may not be the primary challenge. Numerous examples 
from Tesla FSD v12 and v13 show highly social behavior, such as courtesy yielding, effectively 
performing  gap  acceptance  tasks,  committing  minor  violations  in  order  to  make  progress,  or 
driving through Manhattan in highly challenging circumstances (e.g., Black Tesla, 2024; Savage 
Junkie  96,  2024).  As  shown  in  this  work,  the  challenge  lies  more  in  preventing  perceptual 
mishaps, especially for situations that may not be optimally featured in the training data, as well 
as the adherence to rules. 

Despite the limitations of the current study, our present method may represent a viable new form 
of science. The academic system is so slow compared to the developments of certain automated 
vehicle developers that a new mode of describing and evaluating technology must be found. We 
believe that analyses of YouTube content, made possible by content creators who often post a 
commented evaluation on the  day of a new  software release, can provide new and refreshing 
insights into where the future is headed. 

It  has  become  evident  that  developments  are  progressing  rapidly  and  that,  in  some  cases, 
automated  cars  demonstrate  performance  that  conflicts  with  certain  traditional  forms  of 
automation, such as route navigation and traffic light detection. Conflicts between highly intelligent 
AI and comparatively ‚Äúdumb‚Äù humans, or, conversely, highly intelligent AI occasionally making 
dumb mistakes or violating rules, are likely to play a more significant role in the future.

" Okay, so the Tesla RoboTaxi unveiling event was a couple days ago, and it might be the"
 weirdest tech event I've ever been to. You might have seen some clips from it at this point.
" I was there. I rode in the self-driving RoboTaxi. I explored the insane looking RoboVan,"
" and I talked to the Optimus robot, and then I left feeling kind of confused. It was just a"
" weird event. So here are the three main big reasons why. So first of all, the RoboCab. This"
" was the main thing that we knew we were going to see, this full unveiling of a fully self-driving"
" Tesla. And we saw it, and it looked like this. Very, very much like a mini Cybertruck. Like,"
" you've got the light bar on the front, the light bar on the back, the complete lack of rear visibility."
" Then, of course, you can see it's a two-door, two-seater passenger car. People were wondering,"
" like, what a full self-driving RoboCab or CyberTaxi, whatever we're calling it, would actually look like,"
 whether it looked dramatically different from a normal car like a Model 3 or even a Waymo. And
 there are some things that are significantly different about this thing they rolled out. I
" mean, on the outside, it's light gold. Every single one is this, like, silvery gold color,"
 although there was never any mention of actual materials. Pretty small footprint. You can see
" there's no exterior door handles or mirrors or anything like that. And then, since they don't"
" need any steering wheel or pedals, they can sort of push the seating position way back into this more,"
" like, loungy seating position, kind of near the middle of the car. There's a center armrest,"
" and there's a massive 21-inch touchscreen in the center. And yes, the doors go up. As if Tesla hasn't"
" learned from their lessons of the Model X, they're making another crazy set of doors, which honestly"
" is definitely a hit visually. It's a striking feature of this car alongside the wheels, which at"
" first just look like these huge gold discs. But then when you take a closer look, they're actually"
" just normal 21-inch low rolling resistance continental tires, but they've painted half of the sidewall"
" gold to match the caps in the middle. So it makes it look like a super thin, low-profile tire with a"
" huge wheel, but it's not. It's just paint. But either way, no idea how much of this is going to"
" make it to any sort of final production. But after waiting in line for a bit, I got to ride in this"
" thing for a few minutes. So I got in, the screen told me to buckle my seatbelt, and once I did,"
" the door automatically closed. Pretty smart. Then I just selected the destination, which was on this"
" screen along this route, which I assume was pre-mapped, and then it just started rolling."
" Just started going. Now, I've been in a self-driving Tesla before, but this one is just a little bit more"
" nervy since there's people everywhere, and there's no steering wheel in front of me. But once you get"
" over the eeriness of basically being trapped in this driverless car with no manual override, I started"
" looking around and noticing a few other things. You know, you sit pretty low to the road, similar to"
" a Model 3, but with more legroom since the seating position's further back. And then there's even fewer"
" physical controls than ever before in this car. Like, I basically only found that the window switches"
" were in the middle next to the cup holders. I didn't even see any door latches. Like, the doors only"
" opened with a button on this enormous touchscreen. So again, like a Tesla, it's going to control everything"
" in the car on the screen, including just watching movies while the car is driving, because why not?"
 So you can watch the entire trip that I took uncut on the autofocus channel if you want. I'll link that
" below. But then the thing is, that's kind of all we got. Like, there were shockingly few details about"
" the actual car actually explained at this event, other than basically like the three main pillars,"
" which are going to be in all the headlines, which are number one, that it will be fully unsupervised"
" self-driving capable. Number two, that it will be able to be purchased for under $30,000. All right."
" But then number three, that it would actually also charge by inductive wireless charging. So it pulls"
" up over this wireless charging pad on the ground, and it would charge that way. Not something we've seen"
" shipping in very many cars, especially not ones with large batteries. But that was it. No, no other numbers,"
 no other specs. Just look at this thing. There's just concepts of a plan. I just had so many other
" questions from after seeing that, like what is going on here? I did at the event walk around after the"
 announcement and bump into some Tesla engineers and people who have been working on these things.
 And so I just ended up kind of grilling them. Like I asked them a whole bunch of questions. So I'm going to tell you
" guys what I learned from them. And I guess we can take their word for it. So first of all, there is"
" no steering wheel or pedals, as you can see. So my first question was, all right, let's say I see an"
 accident coming or there's something happening on the road in front of me and the car isn't reacting
" in time. Is there a manual override? And the answer I got was, uh, sure, there will be some sort of minimal"
" on-screen controls available, but the goal is that you never have to override, which is a noble goal for"
" sure. I just, I mean, it's hard to imagine. We live in a world where that's impossible basically"
" right now. But, um, I mean, if you, even with the wireless charger picture, you want to like"
" drive over the top of it and line it up perfectly because if it's, if it's off a little bit, that's"
 just a giant waste of power. But if I can't adjust it like that would be terrible. But speaking of
" wireless charging, you might be wondering why they would try to do this. The main answer again,"
" is because they want it to be totally autonomous. They want people to just be able to own several,"
 like a fleet of these things. And they all just drive around and charge themselves overnight.
 And the whole cable plugging in charging thing requires a human. So that's one less human
 required. It'll just line up on the notoriously inefficient wireless charger. But my question
" again was, okay, is there at least a charge port? So if I want to supercharge or charge quickly,"
" I can do that. And the answer was no, there is no charge port on this vehicle. So it is not even"
 capable of hitting a Tesla supercharger or doing any sort of road trips or anything like that.
 It's purely a taxi. I'm told there's no plans for a front trunk. There's just the rear trunk that
 they showed in this presentation. And there's no planned range or stated battery size. But what
 they did say is they're simply aiming for this vehicle to be as efficient as possible. That's their
" main goal. Between the aerodynamics and the low rolling resistance tires, they think they can aim for"
 about 5.5 miles per kilowatt hour. Some of the most efficient electric cars we see today are getting
 around three to four miles per kilowatt hour. So this would be like an A plus efficiency if they
 achieve this. And that's what will let them use a smaller overall size battery for the lighter weight
" of the vehicle. So it'll be nice, they're saying, to clear 200 miles of total range. And that would put"
 this at maybe a 40 kilowatt hour battery pack instead of the typical 70 to 130. So drivetrain
" wise, that logic does check out. If you want to make the cheapest, most efficient electric car of"
" all time, you got to hit those things. But then again, you're also telling us this while doing a car"
" with scissor doors and wireless charging. So that's, you're gonna have some challenges there for sure."
" But really, I think the obvious red flag, the biggest red flag to me is the timeline stuff that,"
" I mean, this is notorious Elon stuff, he gets on stage, he says, we're gonna have this vehicle out"
" for $30,000 before 2027. No, they're not. There's just no way that they're actually going to be able"
" to do that. I mean, if they, if they do, let's say they do, I will shave my head on camera, because"
" I'm that confident they won't do it. Like I want to be optimistic, but there's just too much stacked up"
" against it. Because in order to ship this at all with no steering wheel and everything, they have to get"
" all the regulatory approval for the full self driving and all that, and get all the prices down"
" in spite of inflation, and ship something with scissor doors and all this stuff in the next two"
" years, I just, there's just no way. Tesla's been promising full unsupervised self driving for years,"
" over and over and over again, and consistently keeps pushing it back. But then also just price wise,"
" I get the goal, but Tesla promised a $35,000 Model 3. And years later, I think they briefly actually"
" shipped that car for that price for a little bit before discontinuing it. Cybertruck, I don't know"
" if you remember the, do you remember the base price of what they said the Cybertruck would cost at the"
" cheapest version when it came out? $39,000. And that was about what, like four or five years ago? Do you"
" know what the cheapest Cybertruck is right now? $95,000. So you can see where my skepticism is"
" coming from. But even after all that, you know, there's kind of a philosophical question too, which"
" is, what is the difference between this, this robotaxi thing and a Model 3? Because Tesla has been"
" promising for years, that the car that people are driving and buying today is going to be capable of"
" full unsupervised self driving, like the Model 3 and the Model Y. And it's actually not clear"
" if there's that many differences. I mean, obviously, okay, one's going to have a steering wheel,"
" and four doors and four seats and the whole thing, and maybe be a bit more expensive. But like,"
" yeah, what if my car is going to be able to do all that stuff? I think I want the one that can plug"
 into superchargers and do all sorts of carrying things. Maybe this will be an old fashioned way of
" thinking it sometime in the future, like every every car on the road is autonomous. And it's like an old"
 school thing to want the one with the steering wheel that you can drive sometimes. Maybe. I think
" the main advantage of the robotaxi, if it has the exact same capabilities as a Model 3, is it'll be"
 cheaper and smaller and easier to operate in a fleet situation. That will probably be the main difference
 as far as actually buying these things. Because they've been selling people the dream of the car that
" you buy and own today, you'll drive it to work. And then when you're at work, it'll go drive people"
 around as an Uber for 10 hours or however long. And then you drive it home when you need it. And
" then when you're sleeping, it'll continue to drive and Uber people around. And so it has all these"
 amazing capabilities. It'll do all this great stuff. But will it though? There's actually a moment.
" I had to rewatch the event because I was there and people are like yelling out the whole time,"
" like stuff at Elon on stage. And at this point in the presentation, he goes like, oh yeah,"
" Model 3 and Model Y will also do full self-driving. And then someone goes like, what about the"
" Cybertruck? And then he says, oh yeah, don't worry, Cybertruck 2. So, and it's Cybertruck 2. Yes,"
" of course. Sorry. I don't want to be, yes, yes. All our cars, basically. So yeah, okay. All our"
" vehicles. Great. But then it's kind of quiet, but then someone else yells out, what about hardware 3?"
" Which is a, basically, if you don't know, a reference to older Model 3s and his response."
" So let's not get nuance here. All right. Next slide. So yeah, let's not get too nuance. Let's"
" just get, all our cars will have it, except maybe some of the old ones. All our cars will be able"
 to self-drive though. Totally. We'll cross that bridge when we get to it. How about that? But here's a
" bridge that I don't think we'll ever actually get to cross, which is the second thing that was"
" insane that was announced at this event, which is the Robo Van. So somewhere about halfway through"
" this presentation, they roll out this one-of-one super futuristic looking massive van thing. Kind"
" of looked like a, it looked like the military vehicles from iRobot, to be honest, which that's"
" probably not a good thing, but yeah, it rolls out and they give us, again, very, very few details."
" This is going to be a Robo Van that can hold like up to 20-ish people. And it again, it'll be fully"
 electric and fully autonomous and take groups or teams of people from point A to point B. No manual
" override necessary. Great. Have you ever been to CES? Have you ever heard of, have you ever watched"
" videos from CES? Every year in January, there's this trade show. It's really fun in Vegas. And if you ever"
" go, you'll notice in the South Hall, there's a section with all the cars, the mobility section."
 And you'll find about 50 of these every year. There's just like a van with no steering wheel
 and a bunch of seats that all face the middle. And it's like the future of mobility concept.
" There's tons of those. None of them ever ship, of course, because there are rules. But I guess"
 there's not to me a whole lot that differentiates that brief concept we saw at the Tesla event with
" dozens of other vaporware versions of this that I've seen before. That's all I'm saying. I mean,"
 the fact that this one comes from Tesla is the main differentiator. This is the company that could
" maybe theoretically make it happen. But like I said, there's almost no details about this thing."
 And I have almost no faith that that thing that they showed with its minimal clearance and its
 glass everywhere and just lack of numbers or anything. I don't think that we'll ever actually
" see that thing. I could eat my words, but like that seems crazy. But then last but not least,"
" Tesla decided to bring back, they decided to remind us that they're also an AI company,"
 not just a car company by bringing back out the Optimus humanoid robot again. So they have these
" things all over this event this time, dancing, doing these pre rehearsed demos, but also,"
" they were just kind of out and about, they were serving drinks and snacks. And they were walking"
 around and interacting with and entertaining people just like hanging out amongst everyone
" at this event. Now, I already have my thoughts that I've talked about, you know, humanoid robots"
" before I made a whole video about it. If you want to watch it, I'll leave a link below the like button."
 I've talked about Tesla's Optimus. But even just what we saw with that would have been a huge step
 forward from what we've ever seen. Like this would have been one of the most impressive things ever.
 But then they decided to take it further. They also decided to have these robots talking to people.
" And it was just, I mean, it was way too fast to be an LLM. Like it's just, I'll just watch this,"
 watch this clip.
 Which one are you talking to?
 A piece of chocolate?
 I'm talking to chocolate.
 Right on. What's your name?
 Vanessa.
 Vanessa?
" Yes, Vanessa."
" Nice. Pleasure to meet you, Vanessa."
 Nice to meet you too.
 Have a great night.
 Hi Optimus. Thank you.
 Bye.
" Like it's just, it's just a person. It's a person talking through a speaker. It even like stutters and"
" makes occasional like human mistakes. If you watch a bunch of videos from the event,"
" a bunch of different robots all have slightly different voices. Yeah, it was a person for sure."
" And it's weird because Tesla at no point, at least as of the time of recording, has not"
 acknowledged this at all. They haven't said that or confirmed that. But people there at the event
" have heard various things from various engineers. I talked to two engineers who only would tell me,"
" yes, all of the LLMs do run totally on device. But like, yeah, I don't, that, no, I don't think so."
 So this kind of became like the talking point of the whole event. Like how now we don't know
 how much of this event was real or not so real. Like how much of what these robots are doing
" is human controlled or AI. You know, there were all kinds of hand waving and gestures and movements."
 I played charades with one of them. You know what it reminds me of? Remember that video I did at
" Disney's Imagineering Labs where they had these, these bipedal robots that were controlled by a"
 Steam Deck controller. They did all kinds of walking around and stringing animations together to
 entertain people at the parks. There's just a bunch of button presses and controllers to make that
" happen. And sure, there's some AI to blend that stuff, but you could never deny that there's"
 basically entirely human control happening here. And that's basically what I think is happening
 at this Tesla event. Lots of impressive and entertaining things in the form of a super
" advanced articulating robot string animations together. But there's, it's just not totally"
" ready to do this stuff on its own. We've never seen anything quite like it, even from Boston"
" Dynamics, but we got to be real about the human assisted part. But the thing is the dream that"
 they are selling people with this specific robot is that this thing will live with you.
" Basically, it will be your human sized friend. Actually, they said that it'll be your friend,"
" it would do chores for you, it would live around you and be able to do all these sorts of tasks"
" on its own using the AI and the vision based system. That's, I think that's a really far off dream."
" AI is really, really quickly improving, but I still think that's a far off dream. So you know,"
" to their credit, this event, it was insane. Like they did a lot of things that could have gone wrong."
" And if you told me in 2024, that a company would do a bunch of self driving car demos around tons"
" of people just loose in the road, and they would have bipedal humanoid robots roaming around performing"
" tasks and entertaining people at the same event, and that they would have a drone show. Like that is"
" just a lot of stuff in a row that is super high tech that could go wrong, but somehow didn't."
" And it represented, I think, a very optimistic view of the future, even though it's very much still"
" like concepts. It's a future that is potentially way more efficient, potentially way safer, and more"
" impressive in general technologically than the world we live in today. So that by itself, I think,"
 is honorable. The things that they were hoping to be real would be amazing and inspirational and
" honorable if they actually happened. But since they're also a public tech company, they felt the"
" need to do demos and give all these big promises. And that's where it felt weird, because it's really"
 hard to make promises about when we're going to deliver this future and for what price we're going
" to deliver this future when it just feels very unlikely. And then doing the like robots talking,"
 it's just like now the whole thing is in question. Like how much of it is real? How much of it is fake?
 And then now we're focusing on that instead of how cool the future could someday actually be.
" That's where I'm at. But hey, if there is one company that has the best chance of bringing this all"
" to life, if there's if you made me bet money on one company that I think has the best odds to get"
" there eventually, then it would be the one with the massive data gathering advantage with stuff out"
" there in the real world today, it would be Tesla. So I'll believe it when I see it."
 Thanks for watching. Catch you guys in the next one. Peace.
