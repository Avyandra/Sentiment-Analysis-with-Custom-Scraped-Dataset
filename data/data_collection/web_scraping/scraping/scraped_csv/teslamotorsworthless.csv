The social media posting Trump did this week mocking all the federal employees Musk just fired finally pushed me over the edge. I’m replacing my 2020 M3. What I have discovered in the process is that FSD is apparently worthless. Car dealers will not consider what we paid thousands extra for in determining trade in value. The internet based sites do not consider FSD when determining a value. Neither does Tesla. Has anyone had experience with a private sale? Does FSD have value there?
"Lots of conversations about this topic.
It's a free market, so find someone who values FSD and sell to them."
"After a car is totaled people fight with insurance companies about the value of FSD and almost always lose, so that should tell you something. As
@Dewg
noted, some people value FSD while others do not."

This is not correct. I paid $12K for FSD. My car was totaled after 20 month. Insurance paid me $10K for FSD."

I am glad you got extra for your FSD, but there are many posts of people who did not. For the rest of us, who was your insurance carrier?"
"Another click bate posting headline.
When my X was totaled the insurance determined value by looking at internet equilivent Model Xs for sale, with similar equipment. Essentially got my $ back for having FSD.
Dealerships do not offer $ for FSD as they know that Tesla will erase it upon the 2rd sale (only transfers once)
For private parties, many search for cars with FSD, knowing they can purchase it that way at a discount.
Why would you foolishly sell your Tesla because you disagree with what Elon is doing in his spare time?
Don't fall for the crap the liberal media is screaming about him."

FSD v12.x (end to end AI)
We bought FSD for $6K when we bought Nick (see sig), and we subscribe for Tessie. I calculated that subscribing is smarter for us.  That calculation changes based on  Will they do a free HW4 upgrade? If so, when will they do it? How important is the FSD improvement to you?  And, of course, if...

"Maybe a more accurate way to look at FSD. It’s like an alarm clock that you have to stay away to make sure it goes off at the right time. You can’t go to sleep (the real goal) without paying attention to it. And when it does go off (while you’re watching) Elon will claim it works great!
We’ve been watching this clock for years."
"My suggestion:
1. Turn the TV off.
2. Go outside, take in some fresh air.
3. Recognize that the world is not the panicked sh*tshow that the news wants you to believe.
4. Whether the political trench you've dug yourself in is left or right of center, both sides do awful, immoral, nonsensical things. Both sides, at one point or another, has been just as much the villain as the other. So claiming one side or the other is not the moral high road you think it is.
5. Try to come to the realization that it is crazy to base the decision for the car you drive on politics."
"The answer to ""Is FSD really worthless?"" is..
Its about as worthless as yet another new thread on ""Is FSD ...(X)?""
(not a moderation note, posted as a regular member)."
"When I picked up a used car from Tesla I estimated they bumped prices by a couple thousand for FSD cars.
So not nothing but very very minimal compared to the cost to buy it outright.
80%+ depreciation on the FSD license itself seems plausible."
"I'd imagine a lot depends on whether or not FSD reaches level 3.  If it does, and if a car has FSD and HW4 or higher, I'd pay extra to have it in my car.  I'd also think that once FSD does reach level 3 the $99/month rent to use it will be raised, perhaps significantly.  I also think that since Tesla plans to launch their taxi service in June they have a good reason to expect that level 3 autonomy will be in place by then.
So, if the above happens I'd expect some value to FSD installed cars regardless of how they're viewed now"
"There is no worth to objects except for what value it has to an individual.  If someone doesn't value FSD, then it's not worth anything - TO THEM.  It doesn't not matter what it is or what it does - L2, L3, L4 - doesn't matter.  FSD is worthless unless someone thinks it's valuable.
So be a salesman - and sell someone on its value - get them to WANT to have FSD, and then they'll pay for it.  This is why I always sell my cars private party.  I put $3000 in audio equipment in my car.  Dealerships don't care - they buy on Kelly Blue Book.  But a guy on Craigslist who is an audiophile will pay extra for that setup."
"I bought my 2024 MY LR entirely because of FSD!  I know it is not prefect, but as I get older, (I'll be 80 next year) it will soon drive better than me!  In fact in some ways, it already does.  It certainly keeps centered in the lane better than I, It has 8 eyes to my two and does a much better lane changes, keeps me closer to speed limit, to name a few.
I know I need to pay close attention and I do.  I also keep up at this site to know what to look out for.  But to be able to specify where I am going and let it get me there safely and with fewer upset drivers, city or highway, usually without any intervention until I reach my destination makes it already worth my $8K!
So next time you are following some grumpy old man on his way to church (or to his doctor) at 20 mph wondering in the lane, just think how nice it would be if he had FSD.  Maybe it's your father trying to get his groceries and FSD may save you the trouble having to take him there every Sunday.
So perhaps instead of destructive comments and threatening dump it, help us to make it better and encourage others, (maybe that grumpy old man) and let's help make it perfect or at least close to it.  Maybe some day it will prevent your father (or mother) from being killed or killing some else.
Food for thought,
Clark"

I also think its incredibly stupid to not purchase a brand of car/beer/whatever you would otherwise enjoy due to politics but some people are just too emotionally invested.
The fact is though, on the consumer end at least, there is no competitor to fsd. Blue cruise, super cruise, drive pilot are all a joke, only half passable on some random 10 mile stretch of freeway somewhere in america."
When I was doing a trade in with Tesla they did consider FSD in the value.
"In the past, studies showed it added about $1,000 to the price of a used car, however Tesla itself offers nothing on trade-in, because to them it is just a bit turned on your car. that enables it.     However, if your car is worth less than $25,000 -- and a large fraction of cars are in that range -- you have a problem with a private sale as there is no $4,000 tax credit on private sales, but dealer sales under $25K can qualify for it -- until they take it away.
It would be nice if there were a dealer who you could go to after negotiating a private sale, and they would middleman the deal to your buyer, net $1K for themselves and let the buyer claim the credit, everybody wins (except the taxpayer.)"

A savvy intermediary that makes it as easy as trading your keys and title for payment and that tax break."

The tax break is issued on your tax return as a credit.  The buyer needs to meet certain income requirements, in particular income of no more than $150K (couple) or $75K (single.)    The credit is not refundable, you must have taxes to offset against it, but you can carry forward.     So that makes it hard for the intermediary to hand anybody the money.    The seller must be a dealer/reseller.     That's the part that an intermediary can fix.
With the $7500 tax credit, that can be claimed by companies, and in particular leasing companies.   In fact, if you are over the income limit, the only way to get the credit is to have a leasing company buy the car, take the credit, lease it to you at the post-credit price, and then you can buy it at the end of the lease.    Thsi is worth doing, because even though leases are a modestly bad deal, and cost more than just buying, the $7500 credit, which you can't get otherwise, more than makes up for that.  I don't think that's possible with the $4K credit, but perhaps it is.   However, again one needs an intermediary as it must be a dealer, not a private sale."
