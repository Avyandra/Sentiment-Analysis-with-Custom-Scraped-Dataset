"100% agree. Have had my Model Y LR for 3 days now and so happy with the purchase. The car quality feels amazing and all the anxiety about panel gaps and shotty build quality is right out the window. Pickup and dealer experience was amazing too. Walked in, signed 3 papers, walked out. Took no more than 10-15 min."

Congrats! Enjoy the car and good luck with it.
It is a great EV! The tech makes driving fun again.
"I also had a largely positive experience. 

Still pretty bummed by the lack of USS as the vision is garbage and Tesla’s customer service after the purchase really is garbage, but the car is great"
On day 2. Agree.
"I've had my myp for a week now.

I'm pretty happy as well.

Quality seems alright, but tesla vision sucks.

Overall great value for money."
"With the number of Teslas I see on the road (it’s a significant portion where I live), it’s jarring how many bad reviews there are online. They must be doing something right. I counted 14 model Ys at our neighborhood Christmas event this year. There were only like 45 cars total."
On day 5 and 💯agree
"Agreed, I was pleasantly surprised by the build quality on my 23 Y. On delivery they were also very friendly and told us we could take as much time as we needed on the inspection."
Put a blanket below the car seat including the head rest.  One of those airline blankets they give on the planes.
"I picked my MYLR on 12/3 as well and have had the exact same experience as you with the car seats. I drove almost 400 miles to pick mine up because that was the closest delivery center. My trip back was free because of free supercharging too! Didn't have any panel gap issues whatsoever, and everything works flawlessly - except off-course wipers on auto, and vision going crazy during excessive rain.

I also noticed slight rattle with one of my car seats. When I tried the other one, it went away - so I have to believe it's your car seat."
stoked for you! one year in on a used 2022 MYP and it’s my absolute fav
"Looking at the preview pic, I was like: wow, serious scratches and a positive review? Sounds fun!"
You should put something between the car seat and the seats so you might have some permanent marks over time from the car seat.
Same on the carseat rattle. My Britax is SO LOUD.
Congrats - I see a few alignment issues but otherwise good deal
"I’ll buy an electric car when they will give me one with 1000 km range. Main problem. Second is that i don’t see an electric van 7-8 seats, a good one and affordable i mean."
How about review after few years not few days
"Picking up mine Tuesday, good to hear about the experience :) enjoy"
We have had ours for a month. Love it
My biggest disappointment and annoyance is that I have to turn off AP to change lanes on the highway. The ability to change lanes should be included in the base level AP.
"Serious question, do Teslas with a glass roof have an electric shade you can close? Because it doesn't look like it from the pictures I see?"
"Driving is excellent. 

The touch controls are a nightmare. The animation is useless, the nav is WAY too big, and the controls are tiny and/or minimum 2 clicks away. It could be so much better."
My tailgate leaks from behind the inner tail lights and my DRL occasionally flickers. Other than that it’s been great.
12/02 ? Too early. After 6 months I still can’t give a constructive review. Despite I love the car. I enjoy driving it.
"I also have car seat rattle, mostly notice when I play music with lots of bass at high volume. Can't blame the car for that."

Have you considered downsizing your wheels? This would help with the tire cost and ride comfort. Probably save on W/kWh too.
how's the battery holding up? decrease in battery total est range?
How's your profitability from ride sharing? That's serious driving.
If you get a lot of punctures get the wheel insurance from discount tires.
"Pretty awesome, that is like 248 miles per full charge 75 KWh. Or $5,433.66 to go 100,000 miles on my power rate of $0.18 kWh. 303 Wh/mile. Not bad in a performance."
"is this wrriten by chat gpt

whats your battery stated range now"
What you mean tire woes persist?! You drove 100k miles in less than 2 years!
"I love seeing high mileage EV's!! However, the model Y by no means is smooth."
I worry more about the battery at 100K miles
"At 120k you will be reaching the battery warranty. Are you concerned about that. What would be cost if the battery failed at say 125k mile, that would be a major financial hit and could negate all the savings."
"If you having car problems, I feel bad for you, son. I got 99 problems, but car ain't one"
Any tire recommendations? Would prefer a 19’ smoother ride and not all weather since it’s mostly sun with light rain in California. Have seen hanbook a while ago but not sure if anything’s changed.
How is your battery efficiency now?
I salute you OP
I really hate oil changes. But EV tire lifespan is almost worse given the cost.
OP lives in the car.
"consider ditching tesla's fancy tires and just get AT or light truck tires with a 60k mileage warranty.  They're cheaper, have a much thicker sidewall, have a warranty, and can last ~80k miles"
"Your post sounds like a Tesla spokesperson script...lol.  just kidding.  I also love my Tesla but still only on my 11th month of ownership, so hopefully it stays lovable for many years to come."
"Tesla beginner here (MYLR in a few days hopefully). What is it with the tire thing? I looked up tires for them and at $150-200 a piece for mid range tires that doesn't seem that far off from my current SUV. Sure there are $300-400 range tires, but that's true of any vehicle that weighs that much and can go 0-60 in under 5 seconds. Is there a reason people don't opt for the cheaper tires other than the obvious not last quite as long (but seems like getting 40-50k on a tires for a MY is about all you can ask for anyways). Also why is this car some how more susceptible to punctures? I'm just a bit confused I guess. Sorry for what might be dumb questions. Very excited to get my MY and hoping the tire thing isn't that bad."
Holy crap.  I also have a 2022 MYP but only 18k miles.
Tires are susceptible to punctures? Interesting I never knew 😂😂
Thank you.
How often did you have to replace the tires?
I have the exact same build including the year. Glad you enjoy it! I'm looking forward to the next 70K miles!
"Every time I pass a Tesla, I think Juniper is almost here my time will come will definitely be worth the wait 😂 Sometimes, I park right next to a Tesla, and look back just to see my car next to it imagining how it will feel when it's my old car next to my Tesla in my driveway in the future !"
Having a Modern Spare tire is definitely worth it.
"Playing with the numbers here.

Average of 301.88 wh/mi, neat. I see you're enjoying the performance acceleration, I love my MYP to death. I think the battery is 78.1 kwh with 75 kwh usable, so that puts you at 402.49x 100% fillups (or 670.82x of 20%-80%). Your average range rating with your driving should be 248.44 mi (75 kwh).

30,187 kwh at the average US residential electricity cost (0.23 c/kwh) is $6,943.01, which means your fuel cost per mile is 6.943 cents/mi. The average gas cost in the US is currently $3.090/gal so that's equivalent in cost to 2,246.93 gal of gas, meaning an equivalent gas car would have had to go 44.503 mpg on average to match your fuel expenditure.

A little behind the most efficient hybrids (Prius is rated for 57/56) but still very good and well ahead of the curve for the performance it puts out--and which you are probably getting if you're seeing 301.88 wh/mi. 150 horsepower isn't really a fair comparison to the MYP's 500+ and better internal volume."
"I did 20k miles in a year, and I thought I am doing a lot 😂"
"Let’s wait for 200k miles review. Since no warranty is valid anymore for you, I hope all goes well for you. No heating & ac issue. No battery issue. For next 100k miles. Let’s go!"
"82k miles on my rental ‘22 LR which was probably supercharged 90% of the time and abused.

"Nice review! I just started doing ride share in July with my 2020 MYLR and I’m at just about 28,000 miles, so congrats on your hustling efforts! I hope it paid off handsomely for you. 😊"
I got a 2023 MYLR in October of last year. I agree with this 100000000% so far. It’s been incredible! I love it so much. I came from bmws and Audis. Still love them but wow driving and owning the Tesla is soooo fun.
sept 23 mylr aus build 15k miles flawless
"You been driving to the moon bro? lol 100,000 in less than 2 years is some achievement"
"Hey, what range are you getting? I have a 2021 Model Y with 120,000 miles and even before I hit 100k my range was dropping significantly more and more to the point that on a full charge I’m only getting 273 estimated but realistically I’m only getting 140 miles! And that’s in ideal conditions. I told Tesla before my warranty expired and all they said is the battery is performing as expected. I hate this car, but can’t even sell it because I have negative equity since I bought it a month before Tesla price cut."
"Im at 50,000 miles just over 2 years.  99% happy with mine.  Just replaced the stock tires at about 34,000 miles.  They were about $150 more than my wifes SUV tire replacements.  Discount Tire or Les Schwab will rotate/balance tires for free if you buy there.

&#x200B;

The 1% ding I give it is because there are no lights for the door handles.  I have to slightly buff around the door handles every 6 months because myself and other people have to feel around to find the door handle at night."
"My only comment is the tires cost a lot because they're wider than the average tires, so it's not Tesla's fault. 

I spent $850 on all 4 tires, so it was a big jump coming from a Prius that cost $200; however, you get what you pay for. Wider tires handle and look better.

I actually have a flat tire fixit kit along with a 3/4 ton floor jack in my trunk because getting punctures is normal in California.

Other than that, thanks for the detailed report. Very happy for you that you made money and I hope you made a lot to where it paid ths car off for you.

Cheers."
I’m surprised your riders never complained of the harsh ride on the 21s. I would definitely swap to 19s if I were you.
We opted to purchase tire insurance from discount tires…. It was $35 per tire and already paid for itself after curbing the tire and taking out a chunk of the sidewall (doesn’t cover normal wear and tear)
"great review I just bought a RWD MY.   

  
Great advice on tires . . .  no spare roof"
Thank you for sharing! Would love to see your future updates!
"Any updates, do you still have it? Current mileage? Have you replaced battery?"
Smooth ride?? What smooth ride. These things ride so bumpy and have subpar ride quality
How many miles you at now?
I just did a review of my model y with 100k miles on it here: https://youtu.be/xu0dJ0YTZvk?si=GbJljxbrAVJ75leN
How did you get 100k mies in 2 years? Do you  use it for uber or drive coast to coast?
This was a great read! How is the paint holding up? I'm taking delivery of a black Model Y this week and I'm scared haha
Be glad yours doesn’t have an annoying whine
Love my Tesla but the tire thing is tough. They want nearly $100 for a tire rotation!
But but Elon bad...
Im still not buying any new Tesla nor recommending them due to the massive price depreciation on them.
Blink twice if you need help
$50-$60k car probably worth less than $5k at 100k miles. Nobody buys these cars knowing the battery @ $20k to replace it will happen fairly soon. It’s my worry either way my MYP that I have had 6mos and has 20k miles.
"How many miles did your original tires get before having to be replaced? Same with the replacements.

A big worry for me is tire expenses since the MYP with its staggered tires can’t get rotations"
so how many rides have you done with uber/lyft during this time?
"Wow - I'm racking up the miles at a
Slower pace on my 21’ MYP - 8200 miles."
"\+1 on point 4 - few months back I had gotten a flat (for running over a curb with low tire pressure), all the shops in the city had closed in the evening. Reached out to Tesla RA from the app, the whole interaction following was via SMS and voila within the next hour I had a guy show up with a spare. I just had to make an appt and return the tire myself - all this was at no charge. I paid about $100 to get the car underbody and suspensions checked by Tesla (since I didn't want to take any risk of damage).

Also Tesla gave the option to replace the tire for market price of a new tire and pickup the spare!"
Tires are not an issue with 19” wheels. Anything above 19” is impractical in most cars.
Just replace w all season tires w slightly larger sidewall. And don’t drive it like you stole it. Your tires will last as long as anyone’s.
How much are you paying on insurance for 50k per year lol
I’m kinda surprised they don’t offer a smaller wheel size. A nice light wheel with a low rolling resistance tire would be nice option. More comfortable as well.
Insurance costs?
How much is your insurance and registration? In socal the insurance seems crazy high.
I’m also in New Orleans and thinking about buying a model y performance to do ride share. Would you say it’s profitable?
Did you put PPF on? How does the paint hold up?
"I use my Model Y for rideshare as well. Nice review. Were you not worried at all going off warrsnyisfyet you  hit 50k? Did you buy the extended warranty? 


Got front anf back of front seats covered, inside of doors and door sill wrapped and a backseat cover. It's been almost bullet proof.

Just replaced my tires at 25k from a combo of a nail and low tread. Tread was fine at 20k, then a hard 5k of rideshare burned those sucker's up."
How about the insurance?
I’m afraid the ride comfort is not a pro but rather a con.
"Impressive being able to drive 55k miles/y on a BEV. With such a high mileage and if free supercharging and charging at home, it might have been the cheapest car in terms of TCO on the market

In terms of tires, I think 3 factors you can influence come into play: 
1. your wheels (I see you have the big ones. Tires are more expensive for these. If you’re interested in ride quality and economical tires, choose the smallest wheels)
2. Your driving style (we have no info about this. I have my MDLY always in chill mode and almost never activate brakes)
3. Related to 2, your model (is it the lighter RWD? The faster accelerating models?). From what I can tell we also don’t have any info about this"
was there anything you had to get fixed with the car during these 100k miles?
Totally agree at 70k miles. The tires are the worst part but the wheels look so good I can’t do the practical thing…
"How many sets of tires have you gone through in 100 K? Also do you have a gross income from Uber on hand?

Very curious about doing this with a model three part time."
Completely false claims because you are clearly four miles short 😝
"Thanks for the tip on the fix a tire kit. I should have that, feels weird to not have a spare/donut on me"
"Am I missing something?  I only see 3 images, no review....?"
"How many miles are you getting per fill up when hitting the 100k mile mark? I know its dependent on driving habits but just curious on average for others?

I’m at around 45k and get about 130-150 miles calculating if I fill up to 100%"
I also am doing rideshare with my Y but screwed up by not getting a black one to do Uber black in. I’m wondering which tires you’ve been putting on your bad boy that work the best and are cost efficient.
Can you show the app charging screen for a year I’m curious how much you saved
One thing to consider with your tires is they WILL wear out fast if you constantly use standard mode. Using chill mode and driving like a normal person will alleviate much of tire concerns. My stock tires lasted me 40k miles. I expect my new ones to last over 60k. If you are someone who drives fast and furious then good luck on tires haha.
How much has depreciation affected your bottom line?   100k mile MY is probably worth $20k or less
"I’m surprised by the smooth ride comment .  I like my MYLR but it’s a stiffer ride than I was expecting (based on experience with a forester ,  accord, rav4).   Less of a complaint and more of an observation."
"You forgot to talk about your real range. Two people I know, one with model Y and one with a brand new model X plaid complain about the range. They go to work and later when they leave, the range dropped by 50 miles for no reason lol. Also no one u know is getting near the marketed range Tesla has stated"
"Did you charge at home or supercharger, have you seen any drop in battery performance as result? I have just bought Model Y its been 2-3 months i am so far satisfied with the car. It gives me some relief to hear your experience. 😊"
"Comfortable ride? Even Teslas newest ""comfortable suspension"" is still okay to decent."
How much have you spent on tires
Does mileage actually hurt an EV the way it would another car? I’m up to 30k now
What your commute? I thought i had a lot and im at 19k miles since end of may 2023
Op are you in the Boston area ?
"As someone who's used Uber for the past four months since the engine blew in my Wrangler and finally pulled the trigger on a MYP, I am always excited to get picked up in a Tesla. Once, after taking some models flying, we got picked up in a model 3 and the girls in the back were flashing their titties in appreciation."
"Not a scratch after 22 months?  Where are you, Tesla heaven?"
What is the true range?
How many sets of tires have you been through and how much does it usually run you?
Highly recommend getting all tires insured at America’s tire. They charge $50 per tire. It’s worth it if even one tire is damaged.
"I have been using my 2022 MYP since Feb 2023 for the rideshare in Los Angeles. 
The current mileage is about 59,000 miles. Supercharge 2 times a day 5 days a week up to 90%.
I changed my tire and wheel set 21inch to Gemini 19inch, my current tire is General Tire(very good) I like this tire setup but since it Performance model ride height gets very low and it will cost me when I go through the car wash and I can not use mad flaps.
Battery life, currently 260 miles with a 100% if I fully charge by calculation.
**I hate this seat and Tesla service. Start acceleration is pretty good but after 120mph is not impressive."
I like how your “after” photos hide the paint chips on the front part of the rear wheel well and you didn’t address the craptastic paint quality.

Thank you for sharing. You're absolutely right. Negative experiences get way more visibility and than positive ones
"> Model 3 developed a groaning squeak in the front left suspension.

Shoot I forgot my 2018 had this and Tesla replaced it without question and quickly, great service experience. Was odd too because the car had been parked for ~3 months and just suddenly started doing it at the same time I saw many reports here of it happening to them. Now if I can just get my Model Y some time we can be a 2 Tesla family."
Good to hear about more positive service experiences here in the Twin Cities!
"Posting positive experiences seems pointless, but that's just because they're so common. Having your problem fixed easily doesn't really motivate people to go post their story online.

Like, my last car was a Ford, and I had exactly zero positive experiences with any dealership I brought it to. The best I ever had was ""inconvenient and expensive"" and the worst was ""they made the problem much worse, while also being inconvenient and expensive"". And I've told anyone who will listen how terrible it was.

But I've only had one experience with Tesla service, and it was so fast and easy that I basically forgot it happened at all. They sent out a mobile tech to replace a sensor, they were great with communication, the repair was fast and convenient and free. It was one of the best customer service experiences I've had with any company recently."

Fellow Minnesotan here: The Rogers location is great too!
The people over at the Eden Prairie location are so nice! I picked up my 3 from there and they noticed an issue with the MCU before delivery and replaced it before I took delivery. Was grateful I didn’t have to deal with that.
"Every service appointment with the Portland store has gone well for me as well. I’ve had maybe 10 or so over the years (tire rotations, autopilot computer upgrade, faulty latch on hood, popping door hinge, skid plate fell off when I stupidly went too fast on a flooded street, air filter replacement, wiper replacement, software update to fix Bluetooth issue) and every single one of them was resolved. Only criticism was my seat vinyl started to become sticky and they blamed it on whatever cleaning product I was using. It only happened on the drivers seat back and no other seat. Wouldn’t warranty that so I bought a used seat and it swapped out."
Eden Prairie and Maplewood both have served me well.  The rangers around here are also quite good.
"I usually use the Eden prairie and sometimes the Maplewood one.

My experience is mostly good but only hampered by them not fixing things because they couldn’t duplicate it when I report it. Had a door handle that would randomly act up and I brought it in, they didn’t replace it because it said it was working fine. Had to bring in a video on my phone to show them and they replaced it.

Another time I brought it in and paid for a general inspection just in case before my warranty was over. I reported my heat being really weak and that it wasn’t as good as my other MS. They thermal tested it and didn’t find any problems. It was nice because they didn’t end up charging me at all for the requested inspection which was really nice. Downside is the heater outright failed the next month and I had 400 miles of warranty left haha so that got fixed.

Similar experiences to that. They are very nice though."
"Generally my service experience has always been positive, w/just one service that was not good when trying to evaluate my old X’s shudder problem.  Otherwise Service Centers and Mobile Service has been great.

A couple months ago I was supercharging and there was a Mobile Service there replacing EVERYONE’s wipers for free while supercharging.  What other auto does that?"
I’ve been real happy so far with the delivery and service at the Fort Myers Florida location. 👍👍
"I just had my 2018 model3 in for the same thing. Right front control arm squeak. But it took about 3 weeks to get an appointment and the service took about 8 hours from the time it was dropped off. 

Other than that, no issues."
I was just there the other day. When you walked into service did the rep say “that was one of the worst control arms I’ve ever seen?” Because if so I was there at the same time and had a great experience as well haha.
Yeah I had to use service once. I was conditioned to assume they were going to screw me but then everything went smoothly. Didn’t write a review though 😂. I think I said once that I had no issue last time I took my car in to a thread complaining and got downvoted. 😆
"When I took my 2018 M3P in for the drivers side upper control arm they fixed it. I asked them to just do the other while they were at it but they declined and said they could. Ok, fine. 3 months later, passenger side starts squeaking. I make an appointment and take it in. They replace it. A few days later I go to change my summer wheels for my winter set and find that they had cross-threaded one of the lug nuts on to the stud of the hub they had just worked on. Even a 2 ft breaker bar wouldn't budge. Make another appointment.When I get the car back there is damage to my otherwise perfect wheel. I tell them they damaged my wheel and they say, ""no we didn't. see we have proof"" showing me a picture of the wheel damaged when it is already on the lift. I say, well it wasn't when I dropped it off today and show them a picture of the wheel from that morning before I dripped it off. They basically told me they thought I was lying and that they wouldn't do anything to compensate and that I was lucky that they covered the goodwill service to replace the hub.

I'm glad you had a good experience."
Stop sharing typical service center experiences. We don’t need those.
Yeah I had to use service once. I was conditioned to assume they were going to screw me but then everything went smoothly. Didn’t write a review though 😂. I think I said once that I had no issue last time I took my car in to a thread complaining and got downvoted. 😆
This is good news. It appears it all depends on the service center. I think it probably has to do with an over saturation of the market in certain areas. Therefore waiting on an appointment & parts is a huge deal in some places.
Did they do an alignment after replacing the control arm???
Had the same issue but had to pay because my 2018 was out of warranty. What was your mileage?
"Rule #1 of reddit, no positivity allowed on Reddit!  Please mention your pleasant experience was due to Elon's leverage of slave labor mined blood diamonds."
"OP thank you, I am bringing my 3-year-old Model 3 in for the exact same issue this upcoming Monday. Made me feel a lot better."
"Same issue and same side on a 2019 Model 3. Had appt set for last week but service texted me via app to let me know only had the right control arm and wanted to swap both so pushed appt by a month (due to my availability).

Have only had to use service one other time when mobile connector plastic pin broke off on charging port.  They were nice enough to check my 12v battery while in (normal).

Been very pleased with service and lucked out with location less than a mile from office."
"I have this exact problem with my model Y right now. My first appointment was set for April 6, (in Detroit appointments are 3 weeks out for earliest possible)... they just rescheduled me to May 13th cause they can't get the part til May 10th. So just chilling with a squeaky groan for 8 weeks. I wish we had your experience!"
"1500 miles into my refresh model S noticed a paint imperfection. They told me usually it’s only 24 hours, but said they would warranty it because it couldn’t have been done by me. 

My service dealer has been night and day better than the touch less car drop off who delivered a car with missing trunk cover."
"Yeah I've had nothing but good experiences in VA.

Latest was the browser in my S wouldn't load up, or would crash within seconds.   Someone here mentioned they can just do a remote software re-install, so I put in the request.  I did end up meeting the mobile tech guy near my work, and he managed to fix it.   I felt bad he came out for such a simple problem, but they did it fine!

I used them for a flat tire too, but in hindsight that might've been overkill.  Tire place can patch it for cheap, but Tesla charged 80$   (FWIW the rest of my fixes were all 0$)"
"Only good things from service for me as well, mobile appt for a new side repeater took 2 days and 20min to fulfil from request to invoice (warranty). Guys at my local SC are super nice too, had to stop in twice for some misc parts and they had them for me as a walk in and cheaper than what I used to pay for similar parts from Subaru."
"Ok. Wtf. I have a 2018 model 3 that just developed this same squeaking issue... I still have warranty and they are saying it squeaks aren't covered.. even though the estimate listed that they're planning to replace both control arms.

Advice?"
"3 year old Model 3 here and had the same issue with the front left control arm recently. We made an appointment and the part was back ordered so they resealed the ball joint at our existing appointment and ordered the part. When they received the part, they sent over an estimate that is showing that it isn’t covered by warranty which I thought was weird. Resealing the ball joint seems to have fixed it so I’m not sure if that’s why they aren’t covering it."
"Since 2017, the Las Vegas SC has always treated me well."
"Bad experience for me at the Renton, WA service center. Took it in for three things and they didn't fix any of them."
Good try Tesla PR team.
I had same thing fixed this week along with an issue with the front doors. It took almost 3 weeks to get the appointment and even though they said it would be fixed same day it ended up needing to stay over night for the night shift to finish it. It was a little frustrating since I decided to wait for it but they were able to get me a loaner once it was clear they wouldn’t finish it. So not the best experience but they are very busy and I feel like they did their best to accommodate me.
This kind of thread should be a stickied monthly thing like r/teslamodely monthly delivery thread. We're so used to seeing all the negative reports when all the positives are not even voiced even though they exist.
"I've also had good experiences with the Honolulu service team. They're always packed, but was never left without my car for more than a day.

Had squeeky suspension on my 2020 Model 3 with less than 15k miles. They took it in and replaced both control arms in under 2 hours under warranty even though I have coilovers."
"I think up to the 2020 fremont built would have that defect. We had a recall for inspection for that as well. So I wouldn't be surprised if yours would be covered by the warranty. Took mine in last year after they sent me email. It was okay, MY2020 fremont built in Australia. Also a positive experience."
"1 in charlotte perfect, even got a loaner y  
Mobile service 2x great guy!

Jax FL service center, tech took my car out and was doing 0-80 pulls on the back roads after an alignment, I watched from the app."
Isn't there a rule against posting positive experiences? This just seems out of place.
"Had the same issue and it was fixed as well. So far only positive service experiences as well, but I've also had minimal interaction with service. The only other things done were fixing/replacing flat tires, replacing the 12v battery, and repainting the rear bumper after being rear ended at < 5 mph."
"Between 3 Teslas (soon to be 4), across 2 states, we've had good service and experiences in the rare times we needed something, both mobile service (in both states) and at the SC (in both states), as well as a on-a-roadtrip semi-emergency SC visit in a different location than our home location in one of the states.

I never posted about it because there is nothing to say. I am now reporting a +3 positive data point! (: Note that all of our interactions w/ any kind of Tesla service was under warranty on all these vehicles, although one of the calls was not covered (and this was correct, it was a Model 3 front underbelly cover damaged due to repeated scraping; the cover decided to come loose on a 4500 mile roadtrip and sounded like someone was banging with a hammer underneath the car at highway speeds 😂).

Another note: when vacationing in Santa Fe we got a flat. At the time there were no SCs anywhere near (or anywhere in NM?), the closest was El Paso (obviously ridiculous for a flat, if you know the lay of the land). I have my flat situation very figured out (full size racing jack, full tools, full patch kits, electric inflator, *aaaaaand* an entire spare wheel+tire on roadtrips), if you don't you'll need to figure it out with non-Tesla places in some parts. But this is normal for the most part with many cars, especially cars in the price range of Teslas; just something to be aware of."
First available service appoint over a month away for me. Kind of ridiculous. I guess there aren’t many Teslas in your area yet.
"I've had nothing but positive experiences with the three service centers I've visited since owning the car. Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, and Fremont have all been friendly and professional with no issues.

Well, only issue was somehow they got scuff marks on the roof liner but once I pointed it out to them, they cleaned them up."
I’ve had multiple service calls. It’s all been a dream. Never have I ever been able to troubleshoot / schedule service from an app. Love it.
"You have any idea how much it will be if it’s over warranty? Mine is 3.5 years too and I’m at 50200 miles, I’m hoping they still allow it to be under warranty"
