# Sentiment-Analysis-with-Custom-Scraped-Dataset-
I built and trained my own sentiment analysis models on a custom dataset that was created via web-scraping, reddit scraping, pdf scraping and converting audio to text. This particular project conducted sentiment analysis on Tesla more specifically their FSD system but the code is very reusable and modular. Feel free to try it out.
